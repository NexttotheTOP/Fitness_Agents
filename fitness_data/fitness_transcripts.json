    "transcript": "hi everyone peter here from flow high performance and in this video we will cover how to create a strength training program and how it can be periodized for long-term strength gains [Music] first let's explore what exactly strength is strength is simply how much weight can be lifted in a certain exercise for one rep it needs to be understood that strength is specific to the exercise so getting stronger at one exercise doesn't necessarily mean that you have become stronger at another exercise however the more similar two exercises are the more transfer they will have between each other let's now explore what adaptations can be made which contribute to strength gains the first is technique improvements as the trainee practices and exercise regularly they can become biomechanically more efficient at the lift for example as the trainee practices a back squat they learn how to brace their trunk find the best stance width for their anatomy and squat with minimal lateral knee movement all of these technical factors contribute to making the lift more biomechanically efficient by avoiding force leakage through unnecessary movements the next adaptation that contributes to strength development is neural efficiency this refers to how much force can be produced by the prime movers of the lift in a specific motor pattern this comes down to the ability to recruit all muscle fibers of the prime movers in a coordinated manner neural efficiency once again is specific to the exercise and load so this is best trained using heavy loads with the exercise you were trying to get stronger at and the last primary adaptation that contributes to strength gains is muscle size if a trainee can increase the size of the prime movers of a particular lift then they simply have more muscle tissue that can contribute to force production for example if a trainee increases the size of their chest triceps and dealt muscles with all other factors being equal they have more muscle tissue to contribute to force output and will be stronger at an exercise like the bench press muscle growth is maximized using higher volumes with higher rep ranges of around 6 to 20. now that we have established the fundamentals of strength training let's explore how we can create a micro cycle of training for maximal strength first we need to establish the strength goals for the program because strength is highly specific we need to select the exact exercises that we want to become stronger at for this example let's say the trainee wants to improve their maximal strength in the squat and bench press while simultaneously achieving full body hypertrophy now we need to consider frequency so how many times per week will the trainee be lifting for this example let's say the trainee will be lifting 4 times per week using an upper lower split so days one and three will focus on the bench press while days two and four will focus on the back squat next let's implement exercises for each training session we have two categories of exercises that will be implemented into our program these are our strength lifts that we are aiming to get stronger at and accessory lifts which are there to provide additional volume for muscle growth these accessory lifts will both assist the strength lifts and also provide hypertrophy adaptations for the rest of the body that isn't trained during the primary strength lifts so as we already mentioned this program will use the bench press and back squat as the primary strength lifts so the bench press will be performed on days 1 and 3 and the back squat will be performed on days 2 and 4. next we will need to select accessory lifts accessory lifts have one primary goal this is to provide muscle growth of the relevant prime movers and other muscles the trainee wants to grow one important consideration to make when selecting accessory lists for strength training is the impact on the joints heavy strength training is generally quite taxing on the joints so we want accessory lifts to be as joint friendly as possible taking this into consideration we have implemented the following exercises for this example for the upper body sessions we have implemented the lat pull down cable flies seated row triceps push down and dumbbell curls this uses fairly joint friendly exercises to target the back and biceps since they won't be trained much from the strength lifts and also some isolated chest and tricep work to assist muscle growth for the bench press for the lower body sessions we have implemented the following accessory exercises weighted back extensions belt squats and calf raises these exercises allow additional volume for the hamstrings and calves which won't get much stimulus from the back squat and additional volume for the quads these exercises also avoid additional spinal loading that may be an issue from heavy back squats so we now have a basic weekly structure in place before we plan out a detailed mesocycle of training let's first have a look at how strength training can be periodized over time we need to do this first because the periodization plan will determine how the mesocycle will be programmed the first consideration when periodizing strength training is time to peak this simply refers to when the trainee aims to be at their strongest we can't be in peak condition all year round so we need to establish when exactly we want to perform at our best we need to understand this in advance so we can periodize training to peak at this specific time for this example let's use a time frame of 16 weeks so this trainee aims to be at their peak strength for the bench press and back squat in 16 weeks time to make this 16 week period easier to program and manage fatigue we can break this time frame up into blocks for this example let's break the 16 week cycle into 4 blocks of 4 weeks each let's now explore how volume and intensity can be manipulated over the 16 weeks to reach peak condition for strength training we can define volume as a number of sets performed per week of the particular strength lifts and intensity as the load lifted relative to the trainee's 1rm we probably want to follow a similar general periodization scheme to the one seen in this graph in the first half of the training cycle we want to emphasize hypertrophy adaptations by using higher volumes with lower intensities this will allow a solid foundation of muscle mass to be built which will then enhance maximal strength when specific neural adaptations are trained then in the second half of the cycle we want to emphasize specific neural adaptations to maximize specific strength this is achieved by using lower volumes and higher intensities to reduce accumulated fatigue and perform the most specific training now that we have established the general periodization model of our training cycle we can plan the details of each mesocycle first we need to establish the basic mesocycle structure as we have already established each mesocycle will be four weeks long so for this example the first week will be a deload where volume will be lower to reduce accumulated fatigue from each previous mesocycle the following three weeks will then be regular overloading training with the goal of promoting training adaptations the first block of the training cycle may look something like this the goal of this block is to slowly accumulate volume to promote hypertrophy adaptations as we can see here we have implemented the exercises that we previously selected first let's implement the programming variables for the strength lifts as we can see here we've prescribed the volume for each lift the block starts with one set of each exercise as an introduction week then each week the sets increase by one up to a total of four sets per exercise for each session next we need to implement load because we are trying to emphasize hypertrophy adaptations in this block we want the trainee to lift somewhere in the 6 to 10 rep range so here we have implemented a load of 75 percent of their previous 1rm which should allow the trainee to live somewhere in the appropriate rep range next we have prescribed the proximity to failure using reps in reserve for each set of each lift the trainee will leave one to two reps in reserve this is to ensure that the trainer is training hard enough but not pushing to complete failure now we can start to program the accessory lifts as we can see here three to four sets of each exercise will be performed with a deload week using less volume the loads used for the accessory exercises don't matter to any significant extent as long as they allow the trainee to lift somewhere in the 6 to 20 rep range as we can see here appropriate loads have been implemented and lastly each set will be taken to a close proximity to failure compound lifts use an rar of 1 to 2 while isolation lifts user zero to one rar the next block of training has a pure goal of emphasizing muscle hypertrophy we have already gone through an accumulation phase where volume has increased now the trainee can train with higher volumes to provide the appropriate hypertrophy stimulus as we can see here the exercises have remained exactly the same only the training variables will differ slightly for the strength lifts all variables have remained the same except the volume is now higher than the previous block as we can see here four sets of each exercise has been implemented on each day except for the deload week depending on how the trainee is responding to training the load may also be able to be increased by around five percent if performance has been improving significantly however we still want to work within the 6 to 10 rep range so this should only be implemented if the trainee can do so the variables for the accessory lifts have remained exactly the same as their goal is simply to provide hypertrophy adaptations using high volumes in the 6 to 20 rep range the third block will follow an intensification progression where the goal is to start emphasizing neural adaptations by lifting heavier loads we also want to maintain a reasonable level of volume to maintain or even continue providing some hypertrophy adaptations as we can see here the exercises are the same as the previous two blocks for the strength lifts the volume has been reduced by one set for each exercise per session this is because the loads will now be heavier which is more stressful on the joints so less volume is required to avoid injury the loads used are now heavier and increase each week by 2.5 percent as we can see here the loads start at 80 percent and increase up to 87.5 percent by week four at this point the trainee can use back off sets instead of straight sets if they prefer this means that only the top set can use the prescribed load and the other sets can be reduced by five to ten percent load and performed with higher rep ranges the rir is still prescribed at one to two to ensure a high effort but we don't want to take each set to complete failure and once again the accessory lifts remain the same to continue to provide hypertrophy adaptations and the final block of the training cycle aims to peak the trainee for maximal strength so at the end of this block the trainee will max out and attempt a new 1rm this block aims to maximize neural adaptations while reducing fatigue accumulation so the trainee is in the fresher state possible to perform at their best the exercises have remained the same as the previous three blocks to keep things consistent the volume is much lower in this training block and actually reduces from week two to week four this is once again to reduce fatigue so that the trainee is in a fresh state to maximize strength the loads used here undulate between sessions the first two sessions of the week use slightly lighter loads and the last two sessions of the week use heavier loads this is because the trainee will test their strength in the last two days of the block the reps in reserve have been prescribed as 0 to 1 in this block as we want the training to push harder with these heavier loads this will get them more efficient at lifting heavier loads at slow velocities it also gives the trainee a more accurate indication of where their strength is at so they can start to get an idea of their true strength and what they will be able to lift when they max out and the accessory lifts have now remained the same apart from the volume the volume is overall lower and is especially low in week 4. this is because we still want to perform accessory lifts to ensure we don't reduce muscle mass but we don't want high volumes as this may contribute to fatigue and mass performance [Applause] thanks for watching and hopefully you got something out of this video remember to subscribe if you haven't already"

    "transcript": "the key to making a great muscle building diet is to make it so simple to follow that there is no chance that you will fail what do I mean by that well it's very simple the main thing that you should focus on is convenience let me give you a couple of examples how you can make your diet way more convenient which will lead to you being able to stick to it for a long time without going on some Psychopathic bench or skipping meals that you were supposed to eat because all the binge eating or skipping meals stems from one simple reason and as you might have already guessed the reason is laziness you need to make your diet as easy as grabbing a bag of chips from your cupboard you might think that something like this is not possible but if you use all the tips that I'm going to share with you today it will become a reality when you are building your diet Focus only on couple of simple meals so have like two to three options for each meal and only select between them you don't need to become Goden ramsy couple of simple options is all you need the main focus should be on how easy to those meals are to prepare because the harder something is to prepare the more likely you are to skip it or replace it with junk food I for example always have a protein smoothie or overnight oats for breakfast and do you know why because these foods are so easy to make that I don't even have to think while making them and that's exactly how it should be if I had to wake up and make a Sul for breakfast of course that I would skip it and just grab something that I'm not supposed to eat instead because that's just way too complicated sure you might be able to prepare prepare very complicated meals for like a week but then you will give up anyway because something like that is not sustainable you need to develop a system that you can follow for the rest of your life when you start a new diet and you want to quit it after 3 days you obviously didn't do a great job designing the diet in the first place to make your meals even easier to make take advantage of Handy Kitchen helpers blender for example is a great investment if you are into smoothies frozen fruit with Greek yogurt protein powder or any other protein source is one of the easiest meals in existence and of course I can't forget about the rice cooker honestly if you don't have a rice cooker what are you doing this is hands down the best kitchen helper to simplify your diet the fact that you can just set it and forget it makes it invaluable I wish I had some company that makes rice cookers to sponsor me because I just cannot recommend it enough most rice cookers are not limited to just rice you can also cook oats or steam vegetables the rice cooker will become your best friend trust me now I will show you how to build a muscle building diet that is very easy to follow everyone knows that the main pillar of any muscle building diet is protein that's why the first thing that you need to do is to calculate your daily protein intake you calculate your daily protein intake by using this formula once you know your daily protein intake you should split this protein amount relatively evenly between your meals the number of meals I recommend is between 3 to 6 meals per day and if you ask me why do I need to split my protein intake into multiple meals why can't I just eat it all at once well that's a very good question every time you give your body a good amount of protein you give your body an opportunity to build muscle and because we are trying to build the maximum amount of muscle possible we need to give our body as many opportunities for that to happen I know that some of you are now thinking about eating 16 meals per day but it doesn't work like that that's why I told you to be in the free to six meals range if you want to eat more than six meals per day then you can do so but you won't get any extra benefits from that on the other hand if you are eating less than three meals per day you are leaving gains on the table it doesn't matter if you pick three four five or six meals the results are pretty much going to be the same you should pick the number of meals that works best with your schedule and that you enjoy the most so let's say that our daily protein intake is 150 g and we want to eat four meals per day so if we split those 150 g of protein between four meals we will end up with roughly 37 .5 g of protein in each meal keep in mind that you don't need to hit that number exactly you can be more flexible with it as long as it balances out at the end of the day and once you know how many grams of protein you need in each meal you can just pick a protein source that you want and use the amount of it that is equal to the amount of protein you need in each meal so for example if I pick chicken breast as my protein Source I will need roughly 165 G of chicken breast to get the 37.5 g of protein from it and you just repeat this process for every single one of your meals this will cover all of your protein needs so you can build as much muscle as possible then you can build the rest of the meal around the protein Source you chose so let me show you an example of how this could look if I wanted to create a meal plan for a day we will still be using the same example as before so 150 g of protein spread relatively evenly amongst for Ms which as I said before is roughly 37.5 g of protein in each meal so so protein source for meal one will be Greek yogurt and to get close to the amount of protein we need in each meal we will use roughly 300 G of Greek yogurt now we will do the exact same thing with different protein sources for all of our meals for meal two we will use 165 G of chicken breast meal three will be 130 G of canned tuna and for meal four we will have two scoops of protein powder and that's the most important part done now you can just finish all the meals with stuffed that goes well with the protein source so we are going to do that now protein source of meal one was Greek yogurt so we will add some fruit to make a protein smoothie protein source for meal 2 was chicken breast so here we will add some rice protein source for meal 3 was can tuna so we will add pasta to make a tuna pasta salad and protein source for meal four was protein powder so we will add a couple of rice cakes to make a nice snake before bath and if you ask for example how much rice should I add to the meal my my answer to that is just adding the amount that will satisfy your hunger this meal plan is not taking into account calorie counting or any other in-depth stuff it's all about getting in your protein and then just Auto regulating everything else it's the easiest way of making sure that you will build muscle while not having to worry about counting anything else than that but if you are someone who has a clear goal in mind so either cutting or bulking I have the pleasure to introduce you to my brand new nutrition plans I spend hundreds of hours creating them and today is the day that they are finally finished I know how complicated it feels to create a meal plan for a specific goal for someone who has very little experience with it that's why I created these nutrition plans I compiled everything you need to know about nutrition into an easy to follow step-by-step guide it doesn't matter if you want to bul up lose weight or just maintain your current weight I got you covered I don't want to say that I created a revolutionary system because that would be too egoistical but it's revolutionary I have honestly never seen anything similar to what I have created other nutrition plants are usually pre-written and you can't really change that much about them but I created a streamline process that you can use to create a meal plan using all the foods you like to achieve your goal and the best part about it is that throughout the whole guide I will be making an example meal plan with you so you just have to copy what I do and you are set I believe that this is the easiest way of creating a meal plan out there so click the link in the description and start the day and in the end I just want to thank everyone for the huge amount of support in the last couple of months it truly means a lot to me and I would not have been able to read without you so thank you and an extra thank you to all the supporters on my patreon did you like this video then it will for sure like this one to [Music]"

    "transcript": "hey folks dr mike here for renaissance periodization strength training made simple number 12 how do beginners intermediates and advanced folks train differently when the goal is strength training so first of all which one are you we have a real simple system here at rp to consider it's not dogma it's not set in stone but just give this some thought you're a beginner when you just get gains guaranteed from even partial adherence to the basics you show up and you squat two times a week and your squat just keeps going up you don't have to think about it much and you just keep getting gains you're a beginner it doesn't matter how long you've been lifting and yeah that means some people after six years of training are still beginners at heart that really is what it means intermediate you can call yourself that when you've encountered probably your first plateau to when you know you did the basics pretty well but like your squad or your bench started to uh eek and then it wasn't going up for a while and you had to really rethink it and rethinking usually means you really have to start nailing the basics well to continue to progress predictably you got to really organize your training a bit more organize your nutrition and then you get these really good solid gains once more if you've never hit a plateau you're still a beginner a pretty cool uh sort of categorization there now you can call yourself advanced and when you hear this you're not going to want to call yourself advanced that if the details of the program aren't really really good and set up super well to your exact needs no progress occurs okay and you'll notice people who are advanced when they do meets they'll have some meats hit pr's and some meats are pretty far under on average they're hitting prs over let's say two years but like there's a as many down meats as there are up meats usually when you're intermediate it's all up meats it's just steady progress you look of course you're going to do better at this next meet than the last one when you're advanced that's not quite clear a lot of things have to align for that to happen and when you're a beginner even if like if you compete as a beginner you put like 150 pounds on your total every single time and nobody kind of cares because it's like duh you're a beginner right so that's the categorization we'd like for you to use so when you hear these sort of tips on how to train as a beginner immediate advanced make sure you keep in mind sort of maybe which one you are and in your squat and bench and the other or clean or whatever you may be different one of these your squat may be an advanced squat because nothing seems to work unless you get it perfectly right and your bench might be a beginner bench because everything works so there is a little bit of individual lift treatment here as well let's get right into it so how on average just on average there's some exceptions should beginners probably train for best results well they should probably do mostly sets of five to ten reps why they give you a ton of muscle size and the number one problem in beginner strength training is a lack of muscle size it doesn't really matter how strong you make a muscle that's like this thin as your finger you need a bigger muscle so that's a 5 to 10 add tons of size but in that rep range in which they add tons of strength as well and when you're a beginner just getting bigger is the absolute best way to get stronger so most sets of five to ten that means pretty much no sets of one to three no sets of three to six i know it's crazy a lot of people get into strength training because they like to grind those low rep sets this is a question for the best possible long-term athlete development i'm just telling you it's probably optimal it's up to you or whoever your coach to figure out if they really want that or if they want to engage in some bs and just train for fun training for fun is totally fine by the way just know what you're trading off right so mostly sets of five to ten you mostly focus on the compound basics probably just the core lifts uh and a couple of derivatives very few exercises because you want beginners to get really good at the basics because if you do too many exercises that confuses them it doesn't solidify the technique for the basics nearly as well on that note you want to really focus on technique beginners should add load to the bar only when their technique is stable and good or improving if their technique ever goes south in a session the next session no load additions same load show me that your technique can be better when you do that you have earned yourself the right to put more weight on the bar so with beginners they can quickly get into candy cane deadlifts and rising from the grave squats and all kinds of terrible crap just by pushing the load because their technique isn't solidified yet so technique is always number one here to that end you want to avoid rpe 10 training because technique tends to break down also beginners make such easy gains you don't need our p10 training to push the pace at all you also want to avoid near mrv training much of the time where you get a performance decline so you don't want to smash beginners with tons of volume give them a decent amount get good gains going and just don't touch a whole lot maybe progress a little bit on volume every now and again see how they respond but if they really start to flutter pull back there's no reason to push them because you want them to have a really good time not encounter crazy recovery problems not get hurt and solidify their technique and again ultra high volume training degrades technique by adding tons of fatigue for these folks this probably means whole body sessions all the main lifts every single time you come in it's a whole body session probably three to four times a week you don't want any more than that because it's easy to burn them out now what about intermediates mostly sets of five to ten still because they still need tons of mass but now they're doing tons of sets of three to six as well developing that basic strength often in a basic manner we'll do three months of sets of five to ten and two months of sets of three to six and then go back to sets of five to ten yeah you can peak and begin to peak them with sets of one to three true peaking faces but not too often because intermediates a lot of times get carried away and competing too much and testing too much versus actually training remember when you squat a mediocre amount testing it all the time it's just gonna be like hey you're still mediocre congratulations what you do to leave mediocre behind leave humanity behind bro i gotta throw that in uh what you do to leave mediocre behind is actually train is actually get better at the stuff right it's like you want to get good at math and you just keep taking math tests that's not how you get good at math you open up the book and you go through the practice problems you actually learn the lectures yeah that sucks and maybe it's not as fun as taking a test and seeing where you're at but testing and training are two very different things so you have to take intermediates who are excited about testing their newfound strength raining it a little bit let them test every now and again but mostly trained most instead of five to ten mostly sets of three to six now intermediates can really expand the plethora of exercises they use to try to find the exercises that are the best stimulus to fatigue ratios for them to enhance their strength like some people they'll do close grip benching and they're just not feeling it weirdness in the shoulders they don't connect to the movement but if they do normal grip benching and they do some jm presses they're just grooving on those exercises they just fit their body and their preferences you will never know that if as a beginner you only ever did regular bench and a little bit of close grip bench you'll never even know what a jam press is so try a bunch of different exercises and see what grooves for your strength and strength hypertrophy progress then by the time you're advanced you'll know what really works for you and know how to build programs that aren't guesses because remember in a beginner guessing is fine intermediate guessing is part of the process for advanced guessing will get you in real deep shit because you just you know everything needs to align remember to hit pr guesses by definition don't align but for every now and again when you get a chance by accident so now that we're talking about doing more exercises okay that's great but for the core movements and these other exercises intermediate's going to be training hard so most mesocycles are pushed from an rp of 7 to an rp of 10 focusing on breaking barriers towards the end of each meso the end of each mesocycle even a lot of the middle is going to be weights you've never touched before in your life really good technique no bs but you make little pr's little pr's little pr's intermediate times are great times because you're just always getting stronger bit by bit you look back over the air like oh my god i'm 50 pounds stronger on each lift that's awesome the way that happens is pushing forward right you've never squatted 400 pounds and there's four plates on the bar for the first time like holy crap like wait do i have to do this yes that is the time if you're a beginner a lot of working on technique and a lot of stuff happens sort of by itself you don't really have to put the pedal to the metal because you get gains anyway as an intermediate it's time to really gut up and especially towards the end of the mesocycle put it all in which is super fun and because your technique is so good now because you did a good job as a beginner no problem your technique doesn't break down when you get fatigued so no big deal on that note getting fatigued you're going to move from minimum effective volume to maximum recoverable pretty much in each mesocycle at least for the hypertrophy and strength ones now towards the end of your intermediate phase you're going to get in a situation where the fatigue just from the addition of load alone is going to take you from mev at the beginning of the message cycle or accumulation phase to mrv at the end so you're not going to have a situation where you're doing three sets and then four sets in the five sets and then six and then d load and media mrv you're gonna have a session a situation which you're doing four sets and four sets and four sets and four sets and then your mrv comes down to you and then you have to deal which is great actually keeps the training process simpler at that point you don't have to add sets anymore you start with the same number of sets roughly that you end the mesocycle and the only changes that you're adding load and you'll know when that's a possibility because trying to add sets simply won't work you'll over do your fatigue and your performance will drop and be like well it looks like i can't add sets anymore as far as frequency intermediates will train each movement two to four times a week so you bench two to four times a week squat two to four times a week deadlift on the slightly lower end of that so on and so forth and it's gonna happen in a total of four to six sessions intermediates can handle more work the work capacity is better and they need more work because now they're pushing it further and they need more training to fill out their genetic potential so it's going to have to be more training a lot of times folks will send me a program every now and again to review and be like hey like i'm intermediate almost advanced i'm training three times a week what do you think and i'm like i think you're not training enough right so at some point you gotta train more now on the note of training more eventually become advanced what do you do then well advanced folks generally have tons of muscle size already so they're gonna be training mostly with sets of three to six uh and only sets of five to ten if they need to reclaim size like a lot of times after a peaking phase and an active rest phase you've lost a little muscle size so just one mesocycle of sets of five to ten hypertrophy strength can reclaim and add on a little bit of muscle so you can have another productive strength phase ahead or if they want to move up a class right so if you're a 220 pound power lifter you want to move up to a 242 pound class then yeah you're gonna have to do lots of sets of five to ten because that's a lot of muscle to add but sometimes folks that are advanced or really wiggled into their weight class and there's just not a need slash even logical ability to do the sets of five to ten because it's like well i just want to build more muscle like well you're already like 11 body fat you can't get much lead in that without sacrificing strength and you're already at your weight cap there's just only so much hypertrophy training you can do and you can do some every now and again but most of your training is going to be basic strengths that's a three to six and of course as an advanced individual you're probably going to be competing more often or at least the competitions are very important when they do happen and then of course you do plenty of peaking sets of one to three as far as exercises as an intermediate remember you explored the landscape of which exercises give you your best sfrs by the time you're advanced you should know them damn well and stick mostly to them someone's going to be like hey incline dumbbell press right for your work like nope doesn't carry over for anything it hurts my shoulder like how do you know that well i tried it for four years as an intermediate now i know that you know why grip incline barbell is really my jam if that's the movement we want so you have to know all your stuff and of course you're going to start to vary some things more you're going to vary our petition ranges and intensities throughout the week in order to manage fatigue and percent of stimulus this is why advanced training is a little bit tricky you can't just go all out recover all out recover there's going to have have to be some wiggle room so for example if you do a heavy benching workout you might do some light assistance work at the end the next workout might be lighter benching because you simply can't bench heavy again you're not recovered but maybe more intense assistance work the workout after that might be heavy benching again so a lot more variation here for advanced lifters that wouldn't occur for beginners or for intermediates most advanced training on the relative effort front is going to be between 8 and 9 rpe 7rp might be a little bit too easy for advanced to get their best games okay at that point it might just maintain things 10 rp is okay but it's occurring on more rare occasions because rp 10 for advance is first of all a distinct injury risk rises are so fucking strong and second of all it comes with a massive fatigue toll that you may not want to pay even in the middle of a training cycle which is to say that a meat prep cycle for an advanced person two mesocycles or say one mesocycle of hypertrophy training two mesocycles of basic strength and one mesocycle of uh peaking training that whole thing rp-10 might be hit only at the meat and the rest is rp's eights and nines for the most part was threes and sixes to recover every now and again give that some thought so it's pretty interesting as an advanced person very likely your ability to progress in sets is going to be nil the fatigue is too high only load additions occur week to week which is totally fine sometimes we're very advanced as load goes up sets might actually go down a little bit to let you really have the best performance towards the end without a ton of cumulative fatigue that happens sometimes and as far as training well each movement pattern is probably going to want to be trained two to three times a week notice four is off the table because a lot of times you're so strong that you can't recover from four pushes or four leg workouts or four pulling workouts it's just gonna have to be two to three maybe you can do four but a technique only a recovery only session being one of those not for overloading workouts that entire time or per movement pattern and how many sessions well honestly for the very advanced to be their best five to ten weekly sessions which what do you mean ten that means you have some two a day strategically in order to make sure that you get all of the volume that you need and the frequency you need but if you try to do that and just in a smaller number of workouts what ends up happening is each workout gets so long the systemic fatigue makes the tail end of the workout just crap so for example an advanced lifter they can't do like a squatting movement a pulling movement and a pushing movement productively in one workout because the squatting movement and the pulling movement tire them out so much the pushing movement is going to be too light to even be effective and it's just a waste of time so what you do instead with them is if that's the worker that has to happen on a monday the way your schedule is worked out you take it you split it so what you do is heavy squatting in the morning with let's say moderate pulling break for six hours or something come back and do moderate pushing in the pm because you had that break in between workouts you're refreshed you can actually have a productive workout on all three fronts instead of just two much more advanced there's a reason they're called that folks thanks for tuning in see you next time for the next video"

fast pace keep marching if you have to three two one here we go so we touch one knee 40 seconds here you're going to find that that build up is intense through the planted leg not the one that you're raising right come on guys let's work this it's about desire the physical body can do so much it's in the mind that determination that's what gets you through the moments i know you can i know you will in three two and one and breathe get that water use that towel if you need to good work weight loving that extra effort i can feel it angie and then weights all right i so don't envy you we got straight punches three two one i practiced this workout the other day i got about 20 seconds in with the weights and i thought i'll give them to angie i don't think i can do that not really for that it's tough enough as it is keep that core strong get them punches out powerfully your best punches punch someone as always a body project you can punch anyone you like except angie me or wait that's

moving little side steps now that is what i call a kick-off workout i just figured if you're gonna be here and filming we might as well go in at the deep end right we might as well just go in and get it done how good does it feel now how good do you feel having done that session today a little open up of the arms we're going to start our stretch we just let that heart rate come down it takes a little while and stretch out right leg first with the quad core tight nice deep [Music] and breaths over to the other side i think i'm gonna stay here breathing deep i am honestly still struggling to get my breath back that's how it's feeling get a nice stretch through the quads low impact i'll say it again all standing that was a body changing change juice filled workout course strong and as long as you're here stretching with us whether you press pause 20 times whether you did half of each section or 10 percent of each section it doesn't matter because you can come back tomorrow and do a little bit more if you marched through the whole session that's great never question yourself every moment that you move your body is a step towards the outcome that you want it's not going to be dramatic change comes because of consistent decisions and today is a workout but done however you did with it it is done it is the win and nobody can take that away from you now it's a win we've won it's over unless you're doing another workout and in that case i probably question your sanity but that's up to you lifting up above i am certainly done for the day that's 100 and let's enjoy a nice hang here over as we say luxuriating enjoying and relishing our victory and our own brilliance what a great session excellent job excellent job [Applause] how you feeling wade you're feeling good how'd it go for you [Music] from angie"

    "video_id": "l7jIU_73ZaM",
    "transcript": "in this video I'll be sharing some of the worst nutrition mistakes pretty much every lifter makes at some point myself included in fact I really wish I knew about these things when I started lifting over 10 years ago because if I had just known them from the start I would have made better gains without so many unnecessary challenges all right the first mistake most people make is thinking that you can force feed muscle growth you can't I think a lot of people see Pro bodybuilders eating 5 000 plus calorie diets and assume that if they also want to get big they need to also eat big there may be a kernel of truth to this for some lifters but the reality is that bodybuilding anecdotes are often unreliable that's because Pro bodybuilders have world-class genetics have already been training for a decade or more and are almost always taking large doses of anabolic steroids so it's hard to know if their results are coming from the fact that they're eating big to get big or some combination of those other factors now the reason I say that you can't force feed muscle growth is that studies consistently show that when you over feed someone with a large caloric Surplus they gain disproportionately more fat than they do muscle and this is true even if they're weight training this 2013 study from Garth and colleagues perfectly illustrates the issue with really aggressive bulking these researchers split 47 Elite athletes into two groups one group ate in a relatively large caloric Surplus and one group ate in a relatively small caloric Surplus the large Surplus group ended up eating 621 more calories on average both groups follow the same weight training program for 10 weeks and after 10 weeks this is what they found the group eating in the large caloric Surplus did predictably gain more weight they also gained a tiny bit more lean mass although it didn't reach statistical significance but the big difference was in the amount of fat they gained the large Surplus group gained much more fat than the small Surplus group so eating the extra calories didn't lead to substantially more muscle gain but it did lead to substantially more fat gain these same basic findings were corroborated by a later 2019 study which has led experts in the field to describe nutrition as having a permissive role in muscle building in other words your diet permits muscle growth to occur it doesn't cause muscle growth to occur you can't force feed muscle growth training is what tells the muscle to grow nutrition simply supplies the building blocks if you think of your body like a big building you can think of your training program as the blueprint and the construction crew and you can think of your nutrition as the building blocks if you have way more building blocks than you need they just pile up at the job site this is the muscle you've built and this is what's left over as fat so when looking to build muscle most lifters should be eating somewhere in this range but this line here in the middle being your maintenance calories the number of calories you need to maintain your weight you want to gain muscle faster and are more comfortable with some fat gain you can put yourself in a 10 to 20 Surplus if you'd like to do a leaner bulk a smaller five to ten percent Surplus would be better and if you're trying to prioritize fat loss while still building muscle a slight caloric deficit in this Zone would be better now to be clear I'm not saying that aggressive bulks are necessarily A Bad Thing so-called dreamer bulks have become something of a rite of passage in the lifting world ah and despite what the short-term Garth study found in my coaching experience I have found that more aggressive bulks do tend to lead to more strength gain over the long term aggressive bulking will also help you take up more Total Space aloe bear mode but they can also make your life more difficult the next time you want to cut down and in my coaching experience just end up not being worth it for most people now I'm planning on doing a full video about sustainable bulking similar to the one that I recently did on sustainable fat loss so I'll save the rest of my bulking suggestions for that video okay the second mistake most people make is not realizing that most supplements are overrated now there are a few supplements that actually do work creatine caffeine and protein powder are at the top of my shortlist when it comes to building muscle however even with these three most science-based supplements I think a lot of people including people in the science-based lifting Community still overestimate how much muscle people will actually gain from taking them for example creatine is one of the most highly researched and most efficacious supplements on the market this is true and we hear it so much that I think it leads a lot of new lifters to think they're going to notice a massive steroid like Boost from it in reality most studies show that taking creatine should result in a roughly two to three pound increase in lean mass for example this eight-week training study found that a group taking creatine gained 1.1 kilograms or 2.2 pounds more lean mass than a group taking Placebo similarly the systematic review which pulled together 22 studies on older subjects found that creatine increased lean mass by 1.4 kilos or just about three pounds more than Placebo and those studies ranged from seven weeks to a full year in length again it isn't that creatine doesn't work it clearly does in two to three pounds of lean mass is still significant it's a solid increase and given the relatively cheap price point of simple creatine monohydrate it's definitely worth taking in my opinion however compared to a bodybuilding steroid cycle which can add upwards of 10 to 20 pounds of lean mass in just a month or two it's also worth tempering your expectations caffeine is another supplement that I personally use and it has a lot of scientific research supporting its efficacy for strength power and muscular endurance caffeine can definitely give you a man Dental boost before training and anecdotally I do find it leads to better workouts however the research as a whole isn't particularly exciting when it comes to muscle growth specifically again it isn't that caffeine doesn't work it does it's just important to temper your expectations if pre-workout caffeine is the only thing that's able to get you up off the couch and through the gym doors then it could be having a huge behavioral impact on your gains but if you're going to be training anyway the muscle gains you'll see specifically as a result of caffeine supplementation is nothing astronomical lastly protein powder is a supplement I often recommend that has a large amount of scientific literature supporting its use for muscle growth protein powders are very convenient and can make hitting your daily protein targets easier however if you're able to hit your daily protein Target with high protein foods alone adding extra protein powder won't provide any extra gains so as I see it protein powder simply provides a very convenient option for getting in some high quality protein but it's not magic it's just another food option and again I personally take all three of these supplements and I'd recommend them to any serious lifter who can budget them but as you go further and further are down the list the supplements get less and less promising the third mistake most people make is thinking you need a super high protein diet to build muscle you don't this is actually something I've updated my stance on over the last few years I used to recommend protein intakes a bit higher than I do now but I've updated that based on new research a lot of people seem to think that if you just load up on protein your body will have to build more muscle after all muscle is made up of protein so the more protein you eat the more muscle you'll build it makes intuitive sense but in reality research shows that the effect of protein on muscle growth is magnitude smaller than the effect of training eating protein gives these short-lived blips and muscle protein synthesis while training causes this long and prolonged elevation the elevation that's ultimately driving New Growth now according to the latest research the optimal protein Target for building muscle in a caloric Surplus is 0.7 to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight or 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilo practically speaking I put most people in the middle and going above that range won't cause more gains if you're in a caloric deficit for fat loss shifting proteins slightly higher to 0.8 to 1.2 grams per pound is smart to prevent muscle loss or even allow muscle gain in some instances personally I'm still cutting at the moment and I eat 150 grams of protein per day at 165 pounds body weight so that's about 0.9 grams of protein per pound of body weight for me I just say this to show that even sitting toward the lower end of these ranges is still perfectly fine and I usually only suggest going to the upper end if someone is really shredded and at a particularly high risk of muscle loss of course it's also important to realize that even if you eat below these ideal ranges you can still build muscle it just may not happen as quickly a recent systematic review from Morton and colleagues found that people tend to build more and more muscle as they increase protein but only up to 0.7 grams per pound that's where the trend hits a break point going up from there doesn't seem to do much of anything extra but that doesn't mean no gains occur if you go below 0.7 grams per pound they do if you were to eat just 0.5 grams per pound you'd still build muscle just not as quickly so if you can't afford a high protein diet or you don't want to eat a high protein diet you can still build muscle it'll just take a bit longer and it may also be reassuring to know that the optimal level of protein intake is still quite a bit lower than what most of the bodybuilding magazines say the fourth mistake a lot of people make is misunderstanding meal frequency many people don't realize that the number of meals you should eat per day for fat loss is really up to you now I'm tempted to say that the number of meals you eat per day doesn't matter but that isn't quite true for some people eating one or two large meals per day within a time-restricted feeding window will be much more effective at helping them reduce their total daily caloric intake and lose more fat as a result still for other people restricting their eating window can make the diet feel more difficult they might find that their energy is lower throughout the day and their hunger is less manageable so up for them a higher frequency grazing meal pattern where they eat four or five or six smaller meals spaced throughout the day would most likely be more effective of course the good news is that we have a ton of flexibility to try both that's because the scientific literature shows that when we equate caloric intake and protein intake one approach isn't significantly better than another this is why I think it's very important that people not grind through eating six to eight meals a day just because it's supposed to speed up your metabolism doesn't and why it's also important that people not struggle sticking to intermittent fasting just because it's supposed to be better at Burning belly fat it isn't you just need to find a meal pattern that'll help you follow through on the diet better now it's worth mentioning that muscle growth does seem to be slightly impacted by the number of meals you eat per day but also probably not to the extent that most people think a recent study from 2021 found that there was no significant difference in muscle gained between a group eating three meals a day versus six meals a day so you can eat anywhere from three to six protein-containing meals per day and expect to see very similar muscle growth however another study from the previous year in 2020 found that eating three meals a day did Trend toward more muscle growth than only eating two meals a day with a fairly large effect size even though it didn't reach statistical significance so as of now I think that for fat loss one to six meals per day is perfectly fine but for muscle growth three to six meals is probably slightly more optimal than just one to two meals still I should point out that in the 2020 study the two meal group did of course still make gains and the difference between two meals and three meals wasn't enormous now before we go I want to mention one last thing that I really wish I knew about when I first started learning about nutrition which is the macro Factor Diet app if you aren't aware I'm a part owner of my macro factor and I've been part of the app's development since the very beginning and I truly believe it's the best algorithm-based nutrition coaching app on the market like I said in the video effective bodybuilding nutrition isn't about force-feeding calories finding a magic supplement eating as much protein as possible or keeping to a perfect meal schedule instead the two most important things you can do are consistently hit a caloric Target that's appropriate for your goal and eat enough protein to support muscle mass however because everyone's diet needs are different and they can change over time depending on changes to your metabolism your training habits your body composition you need to continually update your calories and macronutrients macro Factor will take care of all this for you based on your individual body's response to the plan macro Factor's weight Trend tool and regular weekly check-ins will provide feedback and adjustments to help ensure that your weight is moving in the right direction a lot of cuts end up turning into crashed diets because it can be hard to know when and how much to adjust your calories in a lot of bulks turn into dirty bulks because it can be hard to tell if you're gaining muscle fast enough again macro Factor will take care of all that for you with its science-based algorithms so if this sounds like something you'd like to try it for yourself you can get a free two-week trial of macrofactor at the first link in the description box below also make sure you get into the macro Factor Facebook group and subreddit when you sign up because those are both really active communities where you can ask questions post updates share recipes and help you stay accountable all right that's it for this one guys thank you so much for watching don't forget to leave me a thumbs up if you enjoyed the video subscribe if you

evolve into the expert routine third and most importantly it should promote adherence the reason everyone is walking around leaning muscular is not because they've never been to the gym it's because at some point they stopped going and then there is actually a fourth consideration and that is the balance between these factors you see the most effective routine on paper might not be easy to adhere to in real life and if you don't stick to it it's not that effective and if it's not scalable it's not that effective over the long term which means you're less like to stick to it and there's all these synergistic reciprocal relationships but you get the idea a holistic View view point is required and we might have to make some tradeoffs here and there now I expect you've got a life to get to maybe a Spaniel and a 6% variable so I'm just going to immediately show you an example of what I think constitutes a great starting routine for somebody who is new to lifting and wants to improve their body composition and then I'll elaborate and explain all of my logic later in the video so if you do just want to get the goods and dip out you can although I will feel somewhat used first I'd start with three training days instead of the typical Push Pull leg split which is pretty popular and still a good choice I'd do a horizontal Push Pull day a vertical Push Pull day and a leg day I'll explain why later I'd actually do the horizontal Day first and then the leg day and then the vertical day with at least one rest day between each training day so ideally something like this for day one I'd start with a flat dumbbell press when you first start lifting any imbalances you have will feel more pronounced so a unilateral movement will help you recognize these and start ironing them out from day one it's also quicker to set up and probably safer than a barbell press at a time when you might not have a spotter and might not be great at judging what you're capable of we're then going to stay on the same bench and do some incline dumbbell rows it's a quick transition from the last exercise the incline will help emphasize the upper back and traps rather than the lats and it's an exercise that is pretty hard to get wrong in terms of technique next we'll move to a chest fly and we're going to use the PC deck machine for that you can watch this video if you want to know why I think that's one of if not the best chest fly movement but we're also choosing it because it's a quick and convenient transition into our next exercise the reverse pec deck this is going to hit our rear delts as well as any exercise could and that's a muscle group that I think is often overlooked and underrated when it comes to the overall aesthetic of a well-rounded physique at least in my opinion finally we'll finish up with some plain old dumbbell kills a solid exercise with no setup or equipment required other than the dumbbells that you use using so it's not something you're going to be sat around waiting for and that's your first Training Day it should be a quick workout you won't be in the gym forever but you're still going to get some really good return on investment for the time you do spend training day two is a straightforward leg day starting with your compound movement the leg press now there are many options here for leg press squat lunge movements but in terms of the time commitment and technique learning curve you're best starting off how most of us did with the humble leg press further down the line you can move to more free weight movements but right now you just simply don't need those to start building muscle and a lot of those do come with a much greater time commitment for one reason or another next we'll hit some seated leg curl for hamstrings this will give you quads a rest from all the work they did during the leg press so we can get more out of your next exercise the leg extension pretty much the only quad isolation exercise so this should feature somewhere in most programs if there's space for it next standing C phay you could use a Smith machine for these if you prefer but if you do use a step or a ramp if you can eventually you might want to include a seated car pH to but whilst we're keeping it simple with one or the other the straight leg should come first we'll finish up with some hyper extensions which can progress into weighted hyper extensions when you're ready again if we're talking time commitment fatigue and learning curve I'd say these are the best place to start for a beginner hip hinge movement day three we'll start with pull-ups if you can do multiple sets of five or more but that might be a stretch for most beginners so some assisted pull-ups would likely be your first exercise we' then go into our Vertical Press movement I'd use a seated Smith machine here but on a flat bench I really like this as a shoulder press as it has a similar bar path to your free bar overhead press but with the advantages of a Smith machine for Speed and stability which often means that you can press more weight it's also really good for pumping out some extra partial reps after you've hit failure on your final set if you are that way inclined then we're going to move to some straight arm pull Downs for our lat isolation movement these are one of very few lat isolation exercises but they're pretty much easier and all around better than the Alternatives then for our lateral Rays we'll use a machine if you have access to one I think this is the best lateral raise for everyone regardless of experience but beginners in particular can struggle with the technique on dumbbell lateral razes finally for a tricep isolation we'll do some overhead extensions with a rope no hunting around for dumbbells easy technique and simply more effective than the push down alternative so a few things to mention about this split we're alternating between muscle groups like this to reduce the fatigue that lingers from the first time you hit a muscle to the second you can swap biceps and triceps here if you want that's fairly irrelevant I've put biceps in the horizontal day because I think pull-ups work your biceps more than row but it's probably marginal feel free to do what you want we could swap around our first two exercises and therefore our next two if we wanted to prioritize hitting a particular muscle group first in the workout but because of how the exercises are grouped together it wouldn't actually make more much difference I've put the leg day in the middle so I could break up the two upper body days with as much space as possible while still having at least a day in between every session so why this over a typical Push Pull leg split splitting your upper body sessions into a horizontal and vertical rather than a push and pull is going to mean three things one better performance for each individual exercise because of less crossover fatigue you'll overhead press more after a pull-up than you would after a dumbbell press you'll grow more after a press than you would after a pull-up Etc second less muscle soreness which is something that will be at an all-time high when you're just starting out and it can be quite inconvenient this will come partly from the fact that you're effectively doing less work per muscle per session but also from number three increased frequency you see even though you hit biceps directly with your horizontal day you're still hitting them when you do pull-ups same for triceps same for Rear delts Front delts and some back muscles that are involved in both pull movements this means not only are they getting work to some extent more often but due to that they'll acclimate faster and experience less soreness or at least you'll get over that sess stage quicker now we could have run with this theme and split up our leg workout across multiple days and pretty much ended up with something that we'd call a full body split but because many of the leg muscles have much more distinct and unrelated actions I don't think you need to the maximum number of exercises any individual muscle group contributes to significantly in this leg day is two same as our other days now compare that to a typical push or pull day which could get to three or four and we're still kind of in keeping with that opposing muscle group theme when we think about a leg extension and a leg curl still a full body type split is a really good alternative if you're training 3 days a week and I'm not saying PPL splits are bad I'm just saying they're probably better when you training more often now I mentioned at the start that a beginner routine should allow for progression so I want to give some guidance on how you could adapt this routine over time one way would be to increase your sets to begin with I'd start with a very low number per exercise for most I'd say stick to three this is quite minimal but for complete beginners it's enough to make some good progress I'd work up to four sets per exercise and eventually to five sets for some exercises or possibly even for all of them if you have the time at that point you'll be hitting 10 sets per per workout for some muscles and for most people doing straight sets with normal rest periods that should be viewed as an upper limit that means the next step would be increasing the number of training days if you wanted to move from three to four training days actually wouldn't change the split at all I just do four days in a week and then keep rolling over into the following week so week one might look like this week two like this week three like this and so on I'd only change the split if and when you eventually move to 5 days at that point I'd add an upper day and another leg day so the split would look like this the leg day would look similar to the first but it's worth getting a bit of variation in there and the upper day could reflect your priorities but would generally look like a bit of a hybrid between your horizontal and vertical days another way to adapt this program is by changing some of the exercises although they're all pretty good exercises straight out of the gate some of them are chosen at least in part for their convenience because we're still thinking about adherence at that beginner stage but eventually you might actually want to spend longer in the gym so you can dedicate the time and energy to those exercises that take a bit more setup but are ultimately worth it in the long run I have quite a few videos talking about exercises and which I think should make up the core of a program so you can check out those in the description below the final thing to mention is tracking your lifts of course if the goal is to build muscle you should always be trying to get stronger in rep ranges that promote muscle growth so whenever you can complete all of your sets on the given weight increase it next time then stick on the new weight until you complete all of your sets and so on it might be a bit of an arduous task to track every single lift if you're a beginner so either just choose a few I would suggest these or you can use my app for which there is a free 7-Day trial in the description J Lenny is my hero [Music]"

    "transcript": "all right what is going on guys so in this video i'm going to be reacting to my old diet from 10 years ago so the other day i was cleaning out this old filing cabinet over here and i discovered this notebook so this contains my first ever bodybuilding diets the one i want to go through is this one from exactly a decade ago i'll just put a posing clip up here of what i looked like when i was preparing for this show and i'll put a little side by side from my latest posing update from just about a week ago for comparison's sake um so i will say i think i look pretty good here in 2010 but just because a diet worked doesn't mean it's the most effective or efficient way to go about getting lean or getting muscular maybe i could have gotten even better results if i had set this diet up a better way or maybe i could have gotten the same results without having to suffer quite as much and i think after i go through everything in detail i'll do a final diet rating out of 10 so you guys can stay tuned for that all right so other than the comic sans ms font i'd say the first thing we'll notice here is that this is in fact a meal plan i would eat exactly these meals at exactly these times every day with no exceptions it's interesting because back then i actually didn't even know or care what the macros or the calories were i thought that there was something special about these foods eaten at these times that would get me shredded whereas now i think if i was to redo a contest prep diet the first thing i would do is figure out what the calories and the macros are but i was curious so i did before recording here just tally up the macros of this diet so i'll put them up here on the screen for you guys now what stands out to me with these macros first is just how high the protein is eating 265 grams of protein is just overkill to say the least and the fats here are particularly concerning only 13 of calories are coming from fats i like to set fats at a minimum of at least 15 to 20 percent of total calories and the reason for that is lower fat intakes have been associated with reductions in testosterone which is obviously not good for overall health but also not good for retaining muscle generally i'm somewhere in the like 40 to 60 gram range on a contest prep diet as for the carbs and calories i would say the carbs could be a little bit higher but this might just be a necessary evil of getting shredded that isn't something i'd broadly recommend but if you want to get shredded that might just be something that you have to do and i would say the goal when setting up your calories is to keep them as high as you can while still losing at the appropriate rate so you want to be losing about one percent of body weight per week while keeping calories as high as possible but like i said at a certain point you're just going to have to increase that deficit as your metabolism adapts all right so i already mentioned that this is in fact a meal plan meaning it's not a flexible dieting setup but i do think that this diet would be strengthened just by adding a bit of flexibility so for example if i wanted to sub out you know the oatmeal in meal one i could easily replace that with a slice of toast and that wouldn't affect my progress in any way and adding flexibility like this to the diet is going to help in two ways first of all it's going to make the diet more enjoyable you're not being confined to only these foods as long as the diet lasts and secondly i think it's better from a nutritional perspective because you're less likely to run into nutrient deficiencies if you have a variety of foods that you're swapping in and out from day to day and i would say overall the main thing that i find with meal plans is that people tend to only stick to the diet as long as they can stick to the meal plan so unless you plan on staying on the meal plan forever what are you going to do once you come off it and so i would say to start by calculating the macros calculating the calories so then you know how to adjust your nutrition once the the diet is over all right so let's quickly go through this meal by meal so the first meal here you'll see eaten at 7am after 30 minutes of cardio on an empty stomach so at the time i wrote this meal plan i obviously thought there was something special about fasted cardio when it comes to fat loss i don't think that's true anymore research shows that even though you do burn more fat when doing cardio fasted whatever substrate you burn more of during the cardio session itself you'll burn less of over the next 24 hours and the latest systematic review that we have on this has pretty much written this off as a myth so i think you should just do cardio whenever it best fits your schedule or when you feel like you have the best energy and if that happens to be first thing in the morning on an empty stomach then that's totally fine but there's nothing particularly special about doing it at this time of day all right so overall there's a pretty standard bodybuilding breakfast you've got egg whites oatmeal and i would probably get rid of the whey protein powder that's a bit more protein overkill there and i would probably replace that with a piece of fruit like a banana or an apple or something the whole flax seeds here i find this really interesting because i totally forgot that i used to do this but i used to take a tablespoon of whole flax seeds and just pound that back with my protein shake but i think i used to think that there was something special about flax seeds that they had this unique fat burning power or whatever that's definitely not true but i also can't hate on flax seeds because they are extremely nutritious they're a great source of omega-3s high in fiber just an overall nutritious food however the thing is if you're eating whole flax seeds the shell that surrounds the seed itself isn't easily digested so if you're going to eat them whole you want to make sure that you're really grinding the seed down or you can just buy them ground to begin with now if i'm being honest i would probably replace these flax seeds with a different fat source at this point so i could replace it with like say a whole egg or some avocado even some nuts or a nut butter or something like that you know you could leave the flax seeds in once or twice a week but you could easily rotate those food sources in and out okay so the next meal here we've got a scoop of whey protein and 100 grams of broccoli really jeff broccoli and whey protein what's wrong with that so 10 a.m was when my lecture would start i was in university at the time i was so stubborn that i wouldn't eat this meal at like 9 57 it would have to be exactly at 10 am so the professor would get up and start lecturing i would take out the protein shake shake that up like glug and then i would start chomping down on the raw broccoli in retrospect i think there's nothing necessarily wrong with this meal it just doesn't need to be eaten at exactly that time i would probably replace the broccoli with like a low calorie fruit something like a peach a palm or a pear or even a kiwi just make the meal more enjoyable and you could add some nuts or something like some salted almonds to this meal to make it a little bit more well-rounded okay so after that we've got two meals of pretty much just chicken and broccoli there's some fish oil in there i think i'm gonna save the supplement stuff for another video so i have my full supplements sheet here as well it's a doozy so if you guys would like to see me cover that i can do that i've got nothing against the fish oil caps i think they fit in there decently well the main issue i have with this is the pre-workout meal other than the fibrous carbs from the broccoli there's no carb source here that can be used to fuel training i think this is the biggest violation so far other than the comic sans font this is the worst part of the diet so far if you look you'll see in meal 5 i've got 180 grams of sweet potato so what i would do is just take that sweet potato and either cut it in half and put equal amounts of carbs in the pre and post-workout meals or just take all of it and lump it in the pre-workout meal because in my opinion the pre-workout meal is the most important meal of the day because ultimately training is what's going to get the anabolic machinery going and help you preserve or build muscle while dieting and the fact that i only ate chicken and broccoli just isn't a good choice and also i would probably just get rid of that broccoli altogether because that can give you kind of bloating or gas or just general discomfort during training which is not ideal for performance either and there's no need to have a fibrous vegetable like that before training all right so after that it looks like i would have a scoop of whey protein again now i think this is totally redundant the best evidence that we have on periworkout nutrition says that the anabolic window around training is probably about four to five hours in length so if i ate my pre-workout meal at five p.m and then i've got my next whole food meal scheduled for 7 30 the amino acids from the pre-workout meal from the chicken breast are still going to be in my bloodstream so to throw some more amino acids at the bloodstream right after the workout is pretty futile i would say to just wait until that post-workout whole food meal and that'll have all the bases covered when it comes to post-workout nutrition so when it comes to that post-workout meal this is probably my favorite meal of the day i think this is a good well-rounded meal i like the two cups of mixed veggies so it's not just broccoli i've got some peppers i used to have some yellow peppers red peppers and green peppers onions and mushrooms and then the tilapia is a fine choice it's a very lean fish it's interesting because at the time everyone thought tilapia was like a special bodybuilding food like it somehow had these properties that would allow it to really thin out your skin or really dry you out that's just bodybuilding folklore there's no truth to that um so you could easily replace that tilapia with any other fish or really any protein source for that matter i would probably replace it with salmon just because i think the healthy fats from the salmon would kind of negate the supplementation of fish oils you wouldn't have to eat that every day but it is a more appetizing fish in my opinion as well okay and then the last meal i also quite like so i like the casein protein powder i think a slow digesting protein source before going to bed is a good idea i would probably replace it with cottage cheese just because the cottage cheese is gonna have more naturally occurring nutrients and will probably be more satiating because you actually get to eat it with a spoon and i like cottage cheese so it's more appetizing than just pounding back another shake i don't know if i would include the tuna here i hate tuna i probably thought it was a special food back then i probably would take some carbs from breakfast and put them in the pre-bed meal just because i find i can sleep better at night if i have some carbs in the pre-bed meal and there's no reason not to have carbs before you go to bed i used to think that if i eat carbs before bed they'd just be instantly stored as fat but that's a complete myth i did another whole video on that if you'd like to check it out overall i would say i would give this diet a light to decent four out of ten i do think it got some things right so it gets points for including a lot of vegetables it's got enough protein it's got too much protein but i think it's better to have at least a sufficient intake than an insufficient intake so we'll give it like half a point for that i also like the fact that it's not criminally low on carbs or calories i've seen a lot worse on contest prep diets and it doesn't completely cut carbs which a lot of contest prep diets do um so i get some points for those things but it also loses some points so it loses a couple points for not being nearly flexible enough so it's too rigid when it comes to the actual food choices and the timing of those foods i think it's way too low on fat i'd add at least another 10 to 15 grams of fat per day i really am not a fan of the suboptimal pre-workout nutrition with no carbs and the broccoli there not so much a fan of the fasted cardio it's not really a bad thing it's just again not necessary i definitely like to see some more fruit so there's no fruit in this diet probably because i thought sugar would be instantly stored as fat but that's definitely not true and i'd like to see more variety in general so i'd like to see some beans some legumes some nuts and maybe some other grains like some breads or cereals or what have you i think that would just make the diet much more nutritionally complete and i think i'm going to leave it at that for this one if you guys would like to see my thoughts on all my supplements list i'll put it up here just comment down below and let me know if there's enough people interested i'll do another video like this on that um also i'll put a button over here to my ultimate guide to body recomposition that lays out my full stance on nutrition calculating macros supplements sleep everything in there is covered in so much more detail than what i've ever done on the channel so if you'd like to check that out hit up the button over here i'll also link it down below don't forget to leave me a thumbs up if you enjoyed the video subscribe if you haven't already and i'll see you guys all here in the next one [Music] genius genius tilapia this is perfect this is great what's wrong with that"

    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, let's\ntalk about hypertrophy. The topic that\noccupies the minds of so many youth, young men,\nbut also a lot of women. I think one of the really\ninteresting progressions that's taken place in the\nlast decade or so is that far more men and women\nare using resistance training in order to evoke hypertrophy,\ngrowth of muscles, for aesthetic reasons and\nfor all sorts of reasons. What are the ways that people\ncan induce hypertrophy? ANDY GALPIN: So not to correct\nyou or insult you, but probably a better way to think about\nthat question is really, what stimuli do I need\nto give the muscle to induce hypertrophy? Now there are hormonal\nfactors that are important. There are nutritional factors. But just to stick with\nthe context of training. This is really going to\nframe a lot of our answers. And as you'll see, it's\none of the reasons why I call hypertrophy training\nkind of idiot proof, in terms of programming. Now the work is hard,\ndifficult, and all that, but the precision needed\nis a lot less than what we saw in power and strength. And so if you know-- it's\nvery important that you do it in this style, with this intent,\nand within these parameters, and if you're outside\nthe parameters, it's not going to be it. Hypertrophy has a\nvery broad range, in terms of your\nactual applications. And this is why\nyou have, and will continue to see, countless\nstyles of training that all work. I mean, I know you were\nmentored earlier in life by one of my favorite people\nin this entire field, Mike Mentzer. Just an absolute character. His style was completely\ndifferent than what you would see in\na classic textbook or any number of different\ninfluencers or coaches or individuals. And if you've ever thought\nto yourself like, why is it all these programs work? And people love\nto jump to things like, well, it's the steroids. Just get that out of\nthe equation for now. Independent of that, that's\nnot even part of the equation, you're still going\nto see results. And the question is why? Well, that's because\nwhat's driving changes in strength\nand power are the adaptations of specificity. What's driving\nchanges in hypertrophy is much more well rounded. And so you have\noptions to get there. Remember, you're\ntraining a movement and now you're training a\nresponse and a muscle that cause the growth. That's very, very different. So if we look at\nthe classic dogma, we have to basically\nchallenge the muscle to need to come back, in this\ncase, specifically bigger. And the nutrients need to be\nthere to support that growth. Get the nutrients\naside, perhaps we can come in a few more\nminutes and talk about that. So all we really have\nto do is, going back to our dogma of activation of\nsomething on the cell wall, we've talked about this earlier. That's got to induce\nthat signaling cascade. That's got to be strong\nenough to cause the nucleus to react to it, to\ngo to the ribosomes, to initiate this entire\ncascade of protein synthesis. OK. So that signal has to be\none of a couple of things. It either has to be\nstrong enough one time, it has to be frequent\nenough, or it has to be a combination\nof these things. All right, so I can get\nthere with a lot of frequency and a moderate signal. I can get there with very low\nfrequency and a large signal, like more akin to what you\ndo with Mike back in the day, I'm sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nstill train that way. ANDY GALPIN: Still\ntraining that way. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Each muscle\ngroup mainly once a week, directly, and once\na week indirectly. ANDY GALPIN: So all\nyou can-- all you have to do there to\nnot fail is to make sure the training is hard\nenough, and it's going to work. If you choose the\nfrequency path, then you actually have\nto make sure you're not training too hard to\nwhere you can actually maintain the frequency. The only wrong combination here\nis infrequent and low intensity and low volume. That's it. As long as one of those\nthree variables is high, you're going to get there. Because the mechanisms\nthat are needed to activate that signaling\ncascade are wide ranging. And this is why when we even\nsee things like blood flow restriction training, this\nis when you put like a cuff on your arm or your leg\nand you block blood flow and you use no load or as low\nas, say, 30% of your maximum and, you take it\nto fatigue failure, that actually is an equally\neffective way of inducing hypertrophy. Despite the fact\nthat you're using 3, 4, 10, maybe at most, 20\nto 30% of your 100 max. Why? Because you went through the\nroute of metabolic disturbance. Other ways, say, a higher\nload, maybe as heavy as you can for, say, eight\nrepetitions, is going to get through what's\ncalled mechanical tension. And so there's these\ndifferent paths that we can get\nto the same spot. Now eventually, these things\nhave a saturation point. So you don't need all\nthree of these mechanisms, the third one, of course, being\nmuscle damage or breakdown. And I know we want to chat\na little bit about that, but none of these three\nare absolutely required. You can have multiple\nof them in a session. You don't have to\nhave breakdown at all. That is a complete--\nwell, really, it's a flat out lie that you\nhave to break a muscle down to cause it to grow. That's just not needed at all. You have to have one of\nthese three things though. And so again, this\nallows you a lot of flexibility, which is why\ncrafting your program which is best for you is\nactually fairly simple when it comes to hypertrophy. You just have to make\nsure you do the work. And you want to make sure you\nhave a few standards in place with the exercise choice\nand some other things that we'll hit in just a second. But that's really\nthe fundamental way of getting to it, making\nsure either that signal is loud enough or\nfrequent enough to give nuclei a\nconvincing enough reason to spend the resources. Because you have to\nremember two things. In order to grow\nnew skeletal muscle, you need amino acids,\nwhich are your supply. And then you need,\nprimarily, carbohydrates as the energy source to\npower that synthesis process. If you remember\nbasic chemistry, that says if you're going\nto take two atoms and you're going to pull them\napart or put them together, right, that's going\nto take energy. Typically, and most of,\nactually, metabolism, when you split a\nbond, you're going to get-- it's called\nexergonic-- you're going to get energy from that. But when you put them together,\nthat's going to take energy. This is why we call that\nprotein synthesis, right? So you have to\nconvince your nucleus that, one, invest those\nresources in energy, primarily carbohydrate. But number two, and\nmore importantly, invest that supply. There is a ton of possible\nways to get energy, but there's a very low amount\nof amino acids available. And you need them\nfor many more things than just taking your biceps\nfrom 17 inches to 18 inches, right? It's not going to\ndo that if you're in a position where,\nagain, you can't sustain immune function, if red\nblood cell turnover needs to be higher, or any of\nthe other main-- like tons of things that you\nneed proteins for. So you have to be able\nto say, are you sure? You really want to\nspend these resources and build it into\nmuscle, because once we do that it's very\ndifficult to go backwards, break them back down, and\nbring the amino acids back into that availability\npool so we can use them for either another function\nentirely or even another muscle group. That's called protein\nredistribution, by the way, when\nyou say-- maybe you don't do a lot of upper body\nwork and you're training and you're not eating enough\nprotein or a minimal amount and you're doing a lot\nof lifting in your legs, you'll notice your\nlegs will get larger. But that's, actually,\na lot of times you're pulling the\nprotein from, say, your upper body in this case\nand redistributing it back down to the quads. So that's the way-- that's\nwhat you have to get to. [MUSIC PLAYING]"

    "transcript": "what's up guys in today's how-to video I'm going to be running you through some proper form for a few popular exercises common mistakes that are made and simple adjustments that you can make to prevent injury and achieve the best results so let's dive into it okay first up is the squat this is a popular functional exercise that when done correctly is great for building strength and power in the lower body there are a few key points to remember when performing a squat but first let's take a look at some common mistakes one thing I see quite often is the knees buckling inward like this the weight is distributed on the inside edges of the feet and the knees drop to the center it's also common to see the weight shifted forward into the balls of the feet or the toes causing the heels to lift off the floor and the knees to pass over or in front of the toes which we definitely don't want so to correct these common mistakes we want to be sure that as we squat down our chest is lifted knees are pressed out weight is shifted back into the heels and knees are stacked over the ankles as you send up you're pressing through the heels firing up those hamstrings and squeezing the glutes at the top moving into lunges now many of the same rules of a proper squat can be applied here as well whether you're doing a stationary reverse forward or walking lunge here are some things to look out for so again shifting the weight forward lifting the heel off the ground or rolling into the ball of the foot are things that we want to avoid we want to be sure that our chest is lifted weight is placed in the heel of the front foot our knee is always behind the front Ola we are keeping an upright posture as we press straight up and down all right next we have the deadlift so today I'm just running you through the stiff legged version as this is my favorite one for targeting the back of the legs now many people may feel discomfort in their lower back during this movement and typically this is due to incorrect form or too heavy of a weight load now I know it looks like I'm exaggerating here but you guys I swear I see this all the time routing of the spine shoulders hunched forward and letting the weights just drop out of control and using the lower back or the upper body to lift the weight at the same time it's also common to see over arching of the lower back and a high gaze which is causing strain on the neck so to clean this up we want to be sure that the knees are not locked we have a neutral gaze and spine shoulders are rolled back and the core is typed as we stand up we squeeze the glutes at the top and the downward motion is created by pushing that booty back hinging at the hips and lowering the weights while keeping them tucked in close to the legs moving into some upper body exercises now the bicep curl is one that requires proper form it's you prevent injury and really get the most out of this move often I will see a swinging motion that is using momentum from the entire body to lift that weight out there's over arching in the lower back the chest and shoulders roll forward the weights are making their way up and down but there is very little control over the rest of the body so let's calm it down a little and focus on what this should look like it's like pelvic tilt forward to protect that lower back and create a strong core is key elbows are locked to the side and the body stays upright as you perform the full range of motion all the way up and all the way down really focusing on using the bicep muscles putting a good squeeze at the top of the movement the overhead tricep press or extension is another one that may do some damage when done incorrectly now and then I will see that over arching happening in the lower back the chin is tucked in towards the chest and the elbows are flared out to prevent injury and really target the triceps we want to lift the chin tuck those elbows in find a solid stance a pelvic tilt to engage the core and then we hinge from the elbow the upper part of the arm stays stationary as you progress straight up squeezing at the top and then releasing back down also being sure to keep those shoulders pressed down avoiding them hunching up towards the ears now push-ups can be challenging but often by making just a few form adjustments you're able to progress faster and reap all the benefits of this powerful move so a few of the first mistakes are rounding of the spine flaring the elbows outward and to the side and dropping the head forward it's really important to keep the elbows pointing backward and tucked in and close to the body also keeping a nice rigid back tight core and neutral gaze having your hands spread further apart will target the chest while keeping the hands closer inward will target more in the tricep area either option is totally okay as long as you keep the wrists and shoulders in line now our full pushup begins in the plank position as do many other moves such as the mountain climber so anytime we're in this downward facing plank it's really important to keep strain off the shoulders by stacking the wrists directly below the shoulders we also want to find that straight neutral spine untuck the chin and focus on using our breath drawing the navel inward and upward with each exhale when holding the plank the goal is to create a strong solid line with the body we don't want the hips too high or settings loh we don't want rounding or arching in the back and we want to make sure that the knees aren't bent the quads are engaged and the heels are pressing towards the back wall okay the last one for today is the sit-up now you may feel discomfort or strain in the neck with this one this can be due to a weak neck or core muscles or incorrect form a lot of the time I will see this using the arms and hands to pull the head up off the ground curling the head forward so that the chin is touching the chest as well as arching in that lower back now doing this is sure to hurt your neck and will definitely take the focus off targeting and strengthening the core so draw those elbows back gently rest the fingertips behind the head a small pelvic tilt forward will help keep the lower back in contact with the floor and rather than curling inward pick a spot on the ceiling and focus on sitting upward rather than in use the abdominals to lift yourself up and exhale forcefully with every crunch alright guys that's it for today I hope you found this video helpful remember whether you're working out at the gym in a group class or by yourself at home it's always really important to be aware of your body and practice proper form so that you don't hurt yourself and so that you get the most out of every sweat session have yourselves a great day guys and I'll be back real soon with a brand new video"

    "transcript": "we've all seen that guy in the gym bench pressing a ton of weight with hardly any range of motion or the spotter that rips the weight off on every rep even when his help is completely not needed or the guy doing bicep curls looking like he's trying to do the limbo even though you might have laughed at these guys and their terrible form you may very well be making some serious mistakes yourself even if your mistakes aren't as extreme a relatively minor deviation in your form can switch the focus of an exercise away from the muscles that you're trying to target making that exercise far less effective over the years of spending countless hours in the gym both as a full-time trainer and while working out myself i've narrowed down this list to just eight of the most common gym exercises that i see people getting plain wrong and today i want to give you guys some minor tweaks to make all of these exercises far more effective so you can better target the muscles that you're trying to work allowing you to build more muscle and see faster results so let's start with the lower body for our first exercise which is lunges the biggest mistake that i see people of all different skill levels make with lunges is lunging with an almost overlapping stride position what i mean is that people will lunge in a straight line putting one foot directly in line with the other like they're trying to do some complicated sobriety tests this is wrong you want to plant your feet a little less than hip width apart for every lunge while lunges can help you develop better balance the exercise itself should not be a balancing act so there's no need to practically cross your feet over with each lunge another mistake is taking steps too close together when you take a small step forward and lunge with your feet too close together you're going to be making more of a triangle between your legs at the bottom of every lunge usually your knee will also wind up going past your toes or simply just going too far forward which will put excess stress on that front knee on the other hand when you do it right you're going to be making more of what looks like a rectangle shape in between your legs and your front knee won't be going past your toes the last thing about lunges that i want to mention is that you shouldn't let your knee smash into the floor on every rep you can definitely come down to the floor and lightly touch the floor with your knee as long as you do it in a controlled way dropping to your knee on the other hand not only can it harm your knee but it'll also take the tension off your legs at the bottom of every rep now moving on to an upper body exercise we have dips on the parallel bars first of all you shouldn't do dips on a bench since your hands are locked behind your back the exercise puts your shoulders in a very unnatural position that can cause impingement luckily with parallel bars we could do dips without the hands being behind the back but even with regular dips on parallel bars there are still a lot of mistakes here to address first of all you shouldn't be doing partial reps like i see many people doing at the gym if you can't do reps where you go all the way down until your upper arm is almost parallel with the ground then work on improving your tricep strength with other exercises if you have an assisted pull-up machine or resistance bands you can use those to help yourself work through a full range of motion on dips as well not going low enough is a problem but going too low is also a problem you shouldn't go lower than parallel with the floor otherwise you'll once again be placing a lot of stress on the shoulders the other thing that people will do is flare their elbows out way too far while you can flare your elbows out a little bit and lean forward to concentrate more on your chest you don't want to flare them too far out and the last thing that a lot of people do wrong is they try to do dips while keeping their body perfectly vertical even if you're trying to concentrate on your triceps you'll be a lot better off leaning at least slightly forward with your chest in front of your hips on this exercise next up are dumbbell and barbell chest presses the most common mistakes with these are either having your elbows flared too far out or having them too tight together when your elbows are flared too far out you're putting a lot of pressure on your shoulder and your rotator cuff on the other hand when your elbows are too close to your ribs you're shifting most of the tension away from your chest and redirecting that tension towards your triceps and the front of your shoulder now keep in mind a lot of this does depend on grip width as well when you're purposefully trying to do a wider grip on the bench press your elbows will naturally flare out a little wider and the same thing in reverse when you're doing close grip presses your elbows will naturally be a little tighter to your body however ideally with something like a dumbbell press or a regular bench press we want our elbows to be about 75 degrees away from our body but no more another mistake is curving the lower back out too much before beginning the exercise we do want to bring the shoulder blades back and tight together and we also want to maintain the natural lumbar curve in our lower back but we don't want to look like we're bridging while we're bench pressing because this will increase the risk of injury to your neck and to your lower back another mistake is ending off with the weight above or below your shoulders even if you follow an arc-like path during a bench press at the end of the movement the bar or the dumbbells should always be in line with your shoulders not below your shoulders or above your head let's move on to another chest exercise cable flies for some reason with cable flies i see a lot of people bringing their arms and the cables way too far back the problem here is that with flies since your elbows are opened up at a very wide angle there's already a lot of tension on your shoulders when you go too far back you're increasing your risk of hyperextending and injuring those shoulders when lowering the weight you want to aim to stop even with your chest or maybe just a little bit further back before lifting that weight right back up another problem that mostly beginners run into is performing the fly with the elbows locked out not only does this put excessive pressure on the elbows but it also decreases the amount of tension that's placed on the chest which is the muscle that you're trying to target to begin with you want to keep your elbows slightly bent and pretend that you're hugging a really wide tree the last problem you might run into is if you're rounding your shoulders too far forward with flies just like with the chest presses you want to make sure that you retract your shoulder blades and stick your chest out next up is the bent over barbell row with this exercise most people aren't sure where they should be aiming to bring the bar you could bring the bar higher up towards your chest or lower towards your belly button while neither of these are necessarily wrong you should be choosing where to aim for a specific purpose when you row towards your belly button you'll target a lot more of the muscles in the middle of your back and some of your lats as well on the other hand when you do rows closer to your chest you'll be targeting a lot more of your upper back of course this does also depend on how far you bend forward as well now the most serious mistake that i see for any standing bent over movement is forward rounding of the spine normally you'll naturally maintain a neutral lumbar curve but when you're bent over with heavy weight in your hands that weight will be pulling your upper body down and if you don't resist and stabilize the weight properly you can easily wind up with a lower back injury so to prevent this from happening you'll want to stick your chest out and really squeeze your shoulder blades nice and tight together before you even lift the weight up thinking about maintaining a big chest and seeing your chest in the mirror the whole time will help you out quite a bit as well if you still have trouble with your lower back rounding then i also recommend sticking your butt out it might feel weird before beginning the exercise but once you have that weight in your hands and the weight is pulling your upper body down you'll have that neutral lumbar curve that we're aiming for for beginners i found that keeping the head up reminds them to keep their chest up as well because where the head goes the body will follow but you can also pack your chin tight by pulling your chin back into a position that makes it look as if you have a double chin while keeping your eyes a few feet in front of you now the same advice applies whenever you're in a bent over position lifting anything off the ground whether it's a big compound exercise like a deadlift an isolation exercise like a bent over reverse fly or you're simply lifting a heavy box up off the ground the last thing you want to avoid with barbell rows is pulling with your hands instead of pulling with your elbows when you pull with your hands you're going to be targeting your biceps a lot more on the other hand if you focus on pulling that weight up with your elbows you're going to be targeting the back much better another exercise i see problems with is with cable tricep extensions whether you're using an ez bar attachment or a rope the first mistake is not locking your elbows in place your elbows should be tight to your ribs and they shouldn't be swinging back and forth as the weight goes up and down otherwise you'll be incorporating your lats making this tricep exercise a lot less effective the other mistake is standing too straight up in what looks like a perfectly vertical line now while you can get away with this with a rope if you open up the rope at the bottom of every one of your extensions and go around your hips with an ez bar you're not going to be able to come to full extension because your hips are going to be in the way instead you should bend slightly forward to get a full range of motion and to better target your triceps next up is the lat pull down the biggest mistake you see with this one is excessive swinging when bringing the bar down towards your chest when you swing like this not only can you wind up with a lower back injury but you're also using momentum rather than using your lats instead you want to position yourself right under the bar and once again stick your chest out by squeezing your shoulder blades really tight together you want to do most of your reps without any assistance from momentum and only use a little bit of momentum to help squeeze out those last couple of reps as your muscles start to fatigue the other common mistake beginners make with lat pull downs is they'll pull the bar way too low when you go too low you're putting your shoulders in a bad position and you're also limiting the effectiveness of the exercise especially since you'll have to use a lot lighter of a weight to get down that far instead you should be aiming to bring the bar either under your chin or to your upper chest and no lower the last mistake with this exercise is pulling with your elbows too close together in reality when you're doing this exercise you want to pretend that you're trying to bring your elbows behind your back for a more effective contraction and for better targeting of the lats the last exercise that i want to go over today is skull crushers with skull crushers you want to make sure that you keep your elbows close together many people will flare their elbows out way too far with exercises like skull crushers and french curls as well by doing that you're once again taking the emphasis off the triceps the other major mistake that i see is bringing the bar above your head on the way down these are called skull crushers for a reason your target should be your forehead on every rep if you go behind your head it may allow you to lift some extra weight but that's only because your lats will start taking over the movement and then the momentum that you get from your lats will limit the effectiveness of this exercise for your triceps it's a lot more rare to see people going and aiming too low for their teeth or for their collarbones while this might make it feel like your triceps are getting a better workout it's also putting your elbows in a very compromised position similar to squatting with your knees way too far forward the last takeaway point with these is you want your shoulder blades pinched back while doing these just like you were doing for your chest pressing exercises that about wraps it up for today guys as always i really hope this video has helped you out and i really hope

    "transcript": "the dumbbell bench press is arguably the most effective choice for building your chest that said if you don't do it correctly rather than work in your chest you'll end up working more of your other muscles like the front of your shoulders and your triceps there's five mistakes that cause this to happen they're easy to fix but will make a massive difference in your chest curl let's start with mistake number one the first mistake has to do with your arm path typically people use a very wide arm path and press the dumbbells straight up and down this is so common because pressing with this form actually makes the movement feel easier and will enable you to use heavier weights but not only has this form been shown to have a greater risk for shoulder injury but it also just doesn't stimulate the chest very well to maximize chest activation you want your arm path to line up in the same direction that the chest fibers run a wide arm path with the elbows fled out doesn't accomplish this very well and instead lines up better with the front dels and a small muscle underneath the chest called the chical brachialis this is why many of you likely feel this movement more in the front of your shoulders rather than your chest so to align the arm path with the majority of the chest fibers you'll instead want to tuck your elbows to about a 45 to 60\u00b0 angle away from your body and allow your grip to turn in slightly with your elbows just keep in mind that when you apply this form the dumbbells will no longer move straight up and down but rather forwards on the way down towards your mid chest and then backwards on the way up towards your shoulders so once you fix your arm p path it's important that you don't then make the next mistake which has to do with your forearms I remember back in my first few years of lifting I got very strong with this exercise very quickly I take the 95 lb dumbbells and throw them around like they were nothing yeah buddy like wait but I noticed that although my arms definitely got bigger my chest just never really grew eventually I realized what I was doing wrong as the weights will get heavier I'd start bending my forearms inwards more and more without realizing it this is a compensation that very common especially among those who struggle with their chest development this is because by bending the forearms inwards you're actually shortening the lever which makes the movement Easier by taking some of the load off the chest it also gets the triceps more involved to take on some of the load as well and even the most subtle of a Bend can drastically decrease the load place on the chest in fact if we apply very basic physics to get a rough estimate if the forearms Bend such that the weights end up halfway between your shoulder and elbow you would end up reducing the load actually placed on the chest by about half although this can help you lift heavier weights you aren't getting any higher stimulus on your chest and are simply causing more strain to your joints lighten the weight keep your forearm vertical over your elbow throughout each rep and you'll feel the difference right away now even with your forearms fixed you may be guilty of making this next mistake which is the most common mistake I see given that many of us are already stuck in a hunched over posture we have the tendency to round our our shoulders forward whenever we press this is especially true for those with like in chest development because they'll often have stronger shoulders that will want to take over the movement this can lead to the front of the shoulders experiencing most of the growth rather than the chest to avoid this I'd first suggest that you open up your chest before you even do the dumble Press so that you're better able to activate it you can do this by extending your back over a foam roller and then performing over and backs and band pull parts with the band and I'll leave a link Down Below in the description box to the one I'm using here then when you actually go into the movement on the weight down I want you to think about as if you were using your back muscles to pull the weight down towards your chest by pinching your shoulder blades together and then on the way up just avoid letting your shoulders round forward and take over the movement and instead keep your chest up and think about squeezing your biceps into the sides of your chest focus on this every single rep and you'll immediately notice your chest rather than your shoulders now doing most of the work all right so we fixed the shoulders rounded forward at the top but it's important to avoid this next mistake at the top position as well the main function of the chest is horizontal eduction which is simply the act of bringing the arms together this is what makes the Dumbo press such an effective chest Builder since the arms are pulled together under low knowing this you might think that bringing your arms in as close as possible at the top would better engage the chest in fact some people even touch the dumbbells to get at the top however since we're using dumbbells the line of force is straight down because of gravity this means that once your arms are straight over your shoulders there's actually no more tension placed on the chest because there's no longer any Force pulling your arms apart going further than this doesn't stimulate the chest any further and is wasting energy that could otherwise be used towards your next reps so instead to keep constant tension on the chest stop each rep once your arms end up straight over your shoulders so the last mistake doesn't actually relate to form and instead has to do with the Ang angle of the bench the flat dumbbell press is great but most of the growth you get from this exercise will be in the middle portion of your chest which can lead to the upper and lower portions of the chest becoming underdeveloped in fact in a recent 2020 paper subjects that performed the incline bench press experience over double the growth in the upper portion of the chest when compared to subjects that only perform the flat bench press so in addition to doing just the flat dumbbell bench press I'd also recommend doing an incline dumball press once a week as well however when you do this exercise research has shown that just a very slight incline of about 15 to 30\u00b0 is optimal to Target the upper chest this is usually just one to two notches up from the bottom position of a bench for most individuals anything higher than that often causes the front delts to take over instead in fact for some of you even just a slight elevation by placing a weight plate under the end of a bench may be all you need to really Target the upper chest now as for the low lower portion of your chest for most people the flat dumbbell press will already hit this region quite well some studies however suggest that a slight decline can actually help activate this region even more effectively so in this case you can place a weight under the other end of the bench to create just a slight decline try that out see how it feels and feel free to add it to your weekly routine such that you're doing a pressing movement that buys the zeper chest a pressing movement that biases the mid chest and a pressing movement that biases the lower chest just remember that all the previous mistakes we went through appli to these dumball press variations as well now after you apply these various fixes you'll notice that you won't be able to lift nearly as much as you used to it might hurt the ego but realize that this is a good thing it means that your chest is now doing most of the work rather than your other muscle groups and you'll very quickly feel and see the difference this makes to your chest development just make sure that you don't fall back into your old habits as you try to increase the weight over time and guys it's important that you take the same detailed science-based approach to every single exercise that you do that way you can get results faster and without harming your joints for a step-by-step plan that puts this all together for you just head on over to buildwi science.com and take our analysis quiz to discover which of my programs are best for you and your specific body I'd also highly recommend giving these videos a watch next to see if you might be guilty of making similar mistakes with your deadlift or with your squat thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time"

    "transcript": "let's go back to the sort of the the person who's listening to us who wants to take the plunge wants to start doing resistance training um they're clinging to what you said a while ago that hey I can get some really good results if I'm in the gym 30 minutes twice a week and I know that Mike trains eight hours a week but I don't need to be Mike um a lot so tell me what a program looks like let's construct the program for the pick let let's do it as a young let's start with a young person let's start with a young person who actually has been somewhat active throughout their life but it's it's mostly been in sports right they play tennis they play you know uh they did cross country in high school um they've just never been a gym rat sure but they've listened to this podcast enough they've listened to you enough to know like hey there's value in in developing strength and and and I'd like to have some hypertrophy I want I want to look a little better sure okay so I'm coming to you I'm 40 years old um kind of a little intimidated if I'm truthful right don't know what to good I have a whole pack bounce to make you more intimidated so what's our what's our what's our 230 minute day workout look like so I'll describe to you what week one could look like and then I'll tell you how to scale that afterwards is it's not just the same every single week yeah so what you want to do is if you're training twice a week let's call it Monday and Thursday for Simplicity you do want some symmetry so you don't want a situation which you train with weights Monday Tuesday and then you take the rest of the week to do other stuff if you only train twice a week you want it to be roughly evenly spread so Monday Thursday Wednesday Friday that sort of thing and because your muscles don't take usually a whole week to recover but if you push them hard maybe at most half a week you can train every major muscle group of your body in every single session that you do so both Monday and Thursday we'll have every major muscle group being trained routines that have the muscle group SE are called split routines you know chest one day back the next mostly Pro bodybuilders are the only ones that benefit from that sort of thing and there's a lot of nuance about how to execute that sort of thing so whole body training is probably best for almost everyone who is trying to get the health benefits longevity benefits the aesthetic benefits and so on and so forth so the next thing you want to do is you want to conserve time but you want a high degree of effect and that's going to impose some recommendation on us that do both of those things one recommendation is to choose lifts to choose exercises that involve two components one is large muscle masses so you're not going to be doing a lot of like forearm curls or tibialis anterior calf raises where like the muscle you're training is like as much muscle as your pinky finger and that's about it you're going to be training muscles like the quadriceps the glutes the hamstrings the musculature of the back the chest the shoulders the arms Etc and choosing exercises that train those muscles preferably not just one muscle at a time so then we're using muscles uh very efficiently because we're pushing multiple muscles to their limits in one exercise this is generally going to be compound movements multi-joint movements things like pull-ups pull Downs barbell and dumbbell bent over rows that for the back at least Engage The Forum flexion muscles the biceps Etc they engage actually the muscles of the Forum themselves through your grip they engage the posterior aspect of your deltoids the rear delts they engage almost every muscle in the back all at the same time now you do one set of bicep curls but I do one set of underhand pull-ups I got my biceps checked off and I got three other muscles checked off you just have one one of my absolute grotesque pet peeves is to see personal training in major cities training the regular clients housewife who's 55 and having her do like rear delt cable fly one at a time I'm like oh my God is that one made of time and also is there some kind of physique show which the judges said she needs bigger rear ads but nothing else that's the only reason you should be doing that nine times out of 10 so compound movements close grip bench presses push-ups overhead presses upright rows squats deadlifts etc etc etc these are the kind of movements that train multiple muscles at the same time and thus they are insanely time efficient because you do a few exercises and you're like holy crap that's all of my upper body if you do some kind of rowing machine you do some kind of machine or barbell or dumbbell that's a close grip press you do some kind of upright row situation then you've technically trained kind of every single muscle in your upper body to a substantial extent because every single exercise trains three or four muscles at a time so those are the kind of movements we're going to be leaning into the most what about for the lower body same idea so besides a deadlift and a squat RDL various stiff-legged deadlift or good morning RDL is the same category of movement that trains your entire back uh specifically your spinal erector musculature which is insanely important for healthy aging I could talk about that at nauseum and um then it trains your glutes and it trains your hamstrings and it trains your Sartorius and parts of your adductors and it actually trains your calvs too holy crap that's one that's one extra SI you integrate some kind of lunging pattern into that or some kind of squatting pattern be it a hack squat leg press barbell squat you name it and all of a sudden you've run out of muscles to train in your lower body because everything has been uh done to a high degree of diligence again compound movements uh again I see 45-year-old financial advisers who don't have a lot of time they have family obligations they have work obligations they have other hobbies and they're doing like leg extensions in the gym I'm always like man I hope that guy's hurt and has a good reason to be doing those because if he's not squatting or lunging or doing leg presses or something he's just using up time in the gym training one thing at a time for no good reason at all so invariably you've been asked this a thousand times but um when this person's coming into this situation and they don't have a high training history what are the tools you use to teach them how to do these compound movements safely especially the lower body ones right so squats and deadlifts admittedly they're not going to be starting out with a ton of weight but that's the biggest tool starting out with low weight there's no movement the human body can do which unloaded and doesn't and not pushing the muscles and tendons to their Extreme has any higher risk probability than any other movement so you can start with a deadlift or squat that's body weight or less you can brace your arms on a Smith machine and unload yourself while you squat that may be where you have to start you take multiple sets like that that are very submaximal ideally you're there with a personal trainer if not you can just go to YouTube and type in the name of your exercise and it'll pop up we have a huge library for free on YouTube actually the RP hypertrophy app which is one of our apps in our App Suite has every exercise you'll ever see in there has a video demonstration one click away so you look at that ideally you would have a personal trainer because uh live communication about how to exercise uh is irreplaceable because on a video we're assuming that you're assessment of what that is is your assessment of what you're doing which is very difficult oh my God you walk into the gym and they're like I'm squatting you're like that that's not a squat I don't know what the hell someone told you or what video you're looking at that ain't it if you have a personal trainer they can be like o that's really good but I want you to move your hips back more I want you to move down more so on and so forth but basically the first time you ever with someone in a session all you do is you take them through those movement patterns fine-tune their technique with lots of encouragement and you're not seeking Perfection you're just seeking basic competency get your heels on the ground get you squatting all the way down get your back nice and straight listen that's all we want and you'll do three or four of those what are really warm-up sets and you'll just kick them out of the gym three or four warm-up sets per exercise it's a teaching session they never even lifted heavy they never pushed to failure but because they're so unaccustomed to lifting they'll get sore and it's enough tension of disruption that they will grow muscle the next time they come in you work them through a different series of movements let's call it Monday Thursday movements the next week they come in and you do the same workout except maybe that last set of every movement after a few technique oriented sets you uh ask them to go for slightly more repetitions maybe not five but now 10 or you put a little bit of weight on the bar something that gets them like o okay all I feel it this is a challenge and then over time slowly every week you increase the weight a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more until several weeks later their technique looks real good which most people could learn really good techniques it's not that complicated in a few weeks and now they're like kind of struggling with their weights we're finally up to a weight and rep combination that's challenging them physiologically every set not just neurologically for how to do the technique that three or four week sort of Entry period is amazing because it takes the probability of injury and just almost completely eliminates it because you're not just going in there and seeing how strong you are on the first day which believe it or not a lot of people are inclined to do profoundly stupid as reserve for like high school or Junior High kids whatever you're ninth grade [\u00a0__\u00a0] max out don't do that when you're adult it's profoundly stupid especially if you're in your 40s and 50s and 60s and like you don't want to torn Peck with you drive a truck for a living your PE is require for that sort of thing after that sort of um easing in Period you're now competent with the movements you feel yourself competent as a member of General gym culture you don't feel lost a big part of a problem of getting people to go to gyms and actually stick with it is there's this understanding that people have which is itself relatable but inaccurate that that um the gym is for people that know things it's their place it's for that jacked guy it's not for me the thing is that jacked guy to paraphrase another comedian like he's been in the gym enough you should take a few days off you're big you did it buddy the people who really need to be in the gym are the ones who aren't in the gym so the gym is an an infinitely welcoming Place almost all the Jack people are super nice in real life and they're not judging you they're just staring off into space they're Ultra selfish they don't care about you and if you don't know what you're doing you can always ask them and they almost certainly will give you free advice until you're blew in the face so after a few weeks of being in the gym with a trainer you're like this is my place I belong here and I'm starting to push a little hard and then over time you just increase the load on the bar a little bit and if you're no longer getting sore or really tired and sore and tired in such a way that you need until next there is going to get sore and tired you start increasing the number of working sets that you're doing because working sets wise up until this point was just one working set really if you think about it in the first week or two zero working sets they're all practice sets cuz you're so untrained they're work sets for you but they're not to anyone else that's watching a few weeks in one work set a few weeks after two work sets and so on and so on and so on until you're doing anywhere between three and six working sets per exercise there's another twist here for the person that wants to save a lot of time and actually get some cardiovascular benefits as well you take exercises that are responsible for training muscles that can be paired with other exercises which train muscles that are totally or mostly unrelated if I do a seated dumbbell shoulder press I rack those dumbbells I can walk over and do some goblet squats and essentially there's almost no muscle overlap or I can do some deadlifts and there's just no muscle overlap whatsoever and so I could do some cated dumbbell shoulder presses put put it down nice hard set good job two sets left and I could sit for the average of one or two minutes and scroll on my phone but if you're really timec conscious and you want extra cardiovascular benefit what you can do is as soon as you've finished with one group of muscles you take five or 10 seconds Shake It Out breathe it out hit the next working set for that paired exercise while you're doing that exercise the muscles for the first exercise are actually recovering locally and so when you're done with that exercise 5 or 10 seconds later it's set to for the first exercise so you pair these unrelated work sets together unrelated exercise such that when you've done four sets of one exercise let's say a close grip bench press that trains the pushing muscles of your body if you've paired that with a row or lat pull down then really you've done eight total working sets and you've just knocked off 80% of your entire upper body in an amount of time that the dumbbell press by itself guy has just finished only his front delts and triceps so rest times in the gym outside of getting a drink or just trying not to faint are probably not your best friend if you're just going for General Health General Aesthetics this kind of stuff especially beginning so you're either working one muscle group or several with one exercise or you're transitioning between exercises or you're working the other one or you're setting up your weights for your next machine that you're going to be doing which means as soon as you get in and warm up it's go go go go back to back to back to back five or 10 seconds for transition to catch your breath barely but you're really like you're not going to be talking to a lot of people at the gym other than how many sets do you have left in that machine that kind of stuff and so that allows us to condense a lot of work most people will need something like 15 to 30 total working sets for their whole body per session you can condense that into 30 minutes but you're working almost the entire time and it's generally a good idea to do sets of 10 to 30 repetitions because those kinds of uh loads you don't need a ton of time to have your best performance you can get good enough performances with a short time for recovery and because it's a lot of reps not only does it get you very meaningful strength increases because the absolute load is lower much lower injury risks look you do one rep Maxes all the time you're going to have it coming one way or another you never touch any weight that's heavier than a 10 rep max the probability of injuring anyone given set is much much smaller and because it's a higher volume of work you get a great hypertrophy stimulus and you get great cardiometabolic benefits if you're breathing insanely heavy the entire time and sweating like a you know insert favorite analogy here then you will be kind of one and twoing that session for a resistance training check mark and a pretty decent cardiovascular training check mark especially if these are compound multi-joint exercises that require you supporting your body in space you do a set of 15 barbell squats followed by a set of 15 push-ups your cardio is working I mean that's what they torture boxers with and their cardio is outlandish back to back to back to back it's resistance training it's cardio it's both you have two sessions like that per week each one lasting 30 minutes you have two sessions of Zone 2 zone three cardio where you're really trying and four sessions total like that per week with good sleep and good body weight good nutrition you're well on your way to when you see your healthcare provider every year and he asks you oh trying to die sooner or later and you tell them what you do most them be like well that's way more than most of my patients do and if you look at the American College of sports medicine requirements various requirements of what constitutes rigorous physical activity you're getting well into the mix with a sum total if we think about it of 2 to three hours of difficult physical activity of any kind in a week so when people say I don't have time for exercise I get it I get it I don't have children I've heard that when you have children time dilates like black hole type of stuff um but you can probably make time at least for that resistance training session will it be ultra easy no way it's going to be really tough I don't train like that I need my break damn it I'm trying to be lazy and scrolling Instagram between sets but if I wanted to get the maximum results for the minimum amount of time we're working all the time and over time you start with one or two paired sets like that you get up to three or four paired sets like that on five to eight exercises per session holy crap that is a lot of work and it will train your entire body in one session and you will require one to three days of rest afterwards guess what you rest for three days you come back you rest three days you come back there's two workouts in a week each one takes about half an hour and if you ever want the workouts to take less time work faster and rest less and a lot of people want to hear like the hack for how to get really awesome results with very little time spent in the gym but they don't want to hear how to get the hack actually going because they're like wa hold on hold on what's going to hurt like yeah it's going to hurt it's going to be miserable unless you accept the fact that you know all the benefits of endorphins and everything like that it's kind of like you know how do you become a millionaire you're very very good at something you get very very good people skills and you grind for years at starting your Empire like a man I wanted like a win a lottery ticket or something I didn't want all this like everyone knows that's how you become a millionaire I don't want that so yeah you know you can thumbnail and title this how you like but um it's cool to say yeah listen 1 hour a week and you can have amazing benefits of Health quality of life but I'm here to tell you real talk because at RP that company that I represent we just have a policy of never lying to people ever um because we're doing this to honestly help people and business-wise if you start lying to people it's hard to unweave the rainbow after that um is going to be tough but also there is now more and more research accumulating that doing difficult things physically is good for your mental health uh there's a lot of publicity lately to cold plunges uh you know huberman and all that stuff and a cold plunge because it's so annoying kind of makes you um more grateful for the notot pain you're engaging in the rest of the day and it's really good for you I have one better you do a 30 minute session of back to backto back compound free motion or dumbbell or barbell or even machine work and sweat your balls off and huff and puff the rest of the day seems like like a breeze and the Endorphin kick is massive it's like surviving a traumatic episode so the cold plunge has some benefits I'm not entirely sold that they're enormous or extent whatsoever in many cases but this kind of resistance exercise has benefits that if we just took one by one time to talk about in this podcast we could talk about nothing else and do four podcasts in a row that kind of massive benefit [Music] w"

    "transcript": "he goes typically when people think recovery they go what do I add to my program what am I add to my lifestyle to recover better and he goes people are thinking about that literally backwards it's what do I remove hey folks Dr Mike here for RP strength today we're joined by Dr pack who is a sports scientist and a researcher of all things muscle and strength and it turns out that to get jacked and to get strong and to get lean recovery is really important but it turns out not everything you've heard that enhances your recovery does so at all or nearly as well as some of the other things you've heard so pack let's start walking you have a list for us you've checked it twice someone on there is naughty some people may be nice but people are so complex aren't they they could be both sometimes naughty sometimes nice sometimes at the same time you got a list of recovery modalities recovery practices and you're going to start out with the not so great ones we're going to talk about why they're not so great you're going to work your way up to the best ones m so the worst one has to probably be having your spouse yell at you for hours at a time yeah but that can motivate you cuz that can get you angry you leave the house for a few days stress goes down you train super hard for those three days because you're fighting your demons and potentially you make more money because you're now extra driven but now she gets half that is true but in legal advice here much postnups RP strength by the legal services you guys offer what we offer is postnups postnups what's down there recoverywise pack that to you seems like maybe not so worth doing so let's set the context here we're talking about people who want to get jacked maximize muscle growth and strength to a certain degree so the people that watch this channel we're not talking about you know athletes that have 50 competition per week and whatever your random individual who wants to make okay gains and doesn't care if they miss out on a bit of gains we'll start with cold water immersion including cold showers and just sitting in ice tubs and all that jazz that would in my opinion be one of the worst recovery modalities if you are somebody who is again interested in maximizing muscle growth recent meta analysis out of our lab showed that no cold water emerging specifically not only does not enhance muscle growth but it can actually have some delerious effects on hypertrophy specifically meaning that not only you're not getting better gains you're getting worse gains because you're blocking God all sorts of anabolic Pathways I'm not going to get into the well just the really quick getting into it some of the anabolic Pathways in muscle seem to be based on inflammation and inflammation is radically reduced with cold and looks like that reduces some of the muscle growth potential as well mhm bad news does it recover you in any way sure so there are cases where you could use cold water immersion to alleviate soreness and to actually enhance power output um among other um other physiological functions that we typically use to track what is recovery yeah if you can produce high power again we say you recovered for sport for sport yeah so what you've basically done is because the inflammatory Paradigm that occurs with muscles after training makes them worse at what they do for a few days but grows them if you kind of cut that down by doing some cold immersion they recover back to their old performance quite quickly but that's because they haven't done the work of getting better much under the hood and so it's kind of like uh you got a visitor coming in you kind of clean up your room super quick just like put the roaches underneath the couch that clean but you're ready to take guests again exactly not sustainable if you want a clean apartment month after month by the RP Cleaning Service as well it's a great service but uh that was an awesome analogy because this is a exactly how one would use it so let's say you're an athlete and you have um three competitions or three games in a week yes and you're super sore from the first competition you don't care if you're maximizing muscle growth for that one time so you could do cold water immersion and alleviate some soreness help your sort of uh recovery a bit more and get into that next game feeling less sore and a bit more recovered but as far as the average lifter who wants to get a ton of muscle goes buying uh bathtubs and immerging yourself in ice every day after each session although it looks cool and it feels like you've done hard work because it's just hard and it sucks eh no so I would have to rate cold water immersion for people looking to maximize hyy I would have to put it in the F tier F tier are there anything are there any ones that you want to mention exist in the F tier or are we up to the E tier next I think we are going to the etier with still pretty shitty pretty shitty with things like foam rolling okay for example again the current totality of available evidence as far as form rolling goes shows that H you can be more flexible and maybe in some cases slightly alleviate soreness or perceived pain at anyone point or perceived pain but one you're getting plenty flexibility from Full range of motion on resistance training exercises and at the same time as far as longitudinal evidence in terms of foam rolling benefiting your recovery to a meaningful extent where you're now actually gaining more muscle and more strength and performances up there's not really much it's just another way that you could you know spend a few extra minutes get a bit less sore but as you probably know there comes a point in one's lifting career where soreness is still a thing for some muscle groups but is not such a boogeyman that people make it out to be it's not even a boogeyman to begin with you're sore enjoy you earned it eat food and sleep that's me man that's how I feel but many people don't like being sore yeah they they like growing they had to get used to being sore a little bit at least there's also so you mentioned there's based upon the literature there's no rationale here but there's also the opposite and anatomical inference rationale the the way that the human body works the muscles the fascia the skin for foam rolling to do anything that is at a grand level at a molecular level mechanically disruptive enough to do anything you need like 10 times the force as minimum and like you would just get crushed at those forces and well physiology would respond but it turns out fo rolling is such a surface level activity that may do something to Joint appropri reception do something to pain perception make you nominally more marginally more flexible and mobile at the time of doing the event so foam rolling probably is something better to do for five minutes before you do some heavy leg lifting than it is to do like on a random Tuesday evening to recover for your next Thursday leg workout yeah yeah exactly while not focusing on eating actually managing stress and so on and so forth and something that I I want I do want to say here is relaxation is such a huge thing for Recovery actual recovery that benefits people like just watching cartoons or something that a lot of people end up giving themselves so much homework for Recovery exactly they get on the treadmill they get in the fucking sauna they get in the fucking cold plunge they foam roll and that's like two hours of recovery you don't feel recovered from it you feel like you did two hours of purposeful activity which is like work and if you just took two hours of eating a few burritos and watching a couple of reruns of The Simpsons or some shit you will likely recover a deep level and grow more from that than from all that other stuff because some people why am I saying this pack some people you like well yeah foam rolling is not magical but I like it and it's not harm and you go that's true that's true but you have a lot of habits that you like to do that may be wasting a lot of your time and pre preventing you from doing other shit you could be doing and at some point if someone tells you look like you actually don't get more jacked from this at least consider not doing it anymore you know what I mean yeah because it it's like it becomes part of your training routine in general so all of a Superstition almost like baseball players and their various bats for warm-ups and stuff like I got to have this one like do you though yeah do you need that extra 30 minutes every now and then could you have spent that better could you have even spent it training more training more or resting more and because foam rolling is somewhere in that weird middle between the two it's just not quite clear what's going on yes all right the same goes for so we will put foam rolling in the E tier just because you know it doesn't have a negative effect on muscle growth yeah hey that's wow what a tiar right f f tier just was terrible cost you muscle this one is like okay it doesn't cost you any muscle uh the next one hopefully well I'm not going to prove what's the next one the next one would be massage guns which would also yeah so massage guns where are we putting these guns you know where you knowwhere if you have to ask don't worry about the gun yeah don't worry it's somewhere it's somewhere deep and hairy um but massage guns although intuitively whoa massage Gun blood flow blood flow is one of those buzzwords that we say world I hate it yeah same more blood flow brother you have blood flow to your biceps 24 hours a day it is not the limiting factor for your muscle growth holy shit yes so as far as literature on muscle massage guns and muscle growth goes not much as far as recovery goes again similar effect maybe alleviating some soreness and feeling a bit less stiff uh but other than that paying a ton of money and that's where you'd put it even you know between the F and eer and this Infamous thealist um because it cost much more than form rolling and at the same time you see people get obsessive with it to the to the point where it's like bro you don't need why are you 20 minutes pounding yourself with a massage gun no I can answer some of those questions yes if you replace massage gun with another tool or just stop it pounding yourself um I feel that man and from the last I took a look at the deeper literature on recovery adaptation it's been a little while what I noticed from it and the some of this I'm paring my colleague Dr James Hoffman absolutely an unquestionably the most recovery assistive part of massage is the fact that you have a very huge rise in parasympathetic recovery nervous system activity and a huge fall in sympathetic uh fight ORF flight activity it is a hugely Pro recovery activity physiologically because it relaxes you completely and you can really enjoy it that's why the umbrella term in sport Science for things like massage that help you is actually called compassionate touch it's not called massage massage is one kind of compassionate touch because it terms out the fatigue you can drop from your girlfriend just cuddling you for 30 minutes is really similar to sport massage for 30 minutes yes as measured by hormone levels parasympathetic versus sympathetic nervous system activity and perceive degree of recovery and benefit but having your girlfriend just kind of grope you for a while he doesn't seem culturally has anything to do with sports or getting jacked so people are like well that's just fun times but I need to go drive 45 minutes One Way lay on a fucking terrible bed that looks like an SNM device have them splain the out massage gone my taint which I think is the most pertinent part of the body for recovery for 45 minutes which feels terrible people ask you ask people about sport massage and about the massage gun they like do you like it they're like I hate but I do it for Recovery all right better be doing something under the hood but it's not that sucks so maybe fuck all that what you really need is someone to just recognize that you're human being look you in the eyes touch you in a oh anywhere really is a good start maybe in a special place and then that compassionate touching may be the thing giving you all the benefits you think you're getting from massage or massage gun but it's just the fact that even you're touching yourself which is a good start if you have no one else around yeah for sure but nice that you touch on sport massage as well cuz that would be the next actual like manual massage from another human being and it's funny that you said that people say oh it sucks cuz usually sport massages associated with pain grotesque pain yes but if we look again at the L literature things don't look that great and as far as a game changer for Recovery goes if we even look at literature that has gone physiotherapist to try and identify trigger points or muscle knots I still don't know what trigger points are uh and I and muscle knots are for sure just nonsense that's anatomically impossible but are trigger points real is that a thing it's a it's sometimes used obviously I'm not a massage expert but um they they're sometimes used interchangeably so knots and trigger points but when they've had physiotherapists go okay all right identify the trigger points like many times they don't find the same things sure CU like you'll go to a massage um therapist and they'll go you'll say oh yeah my forearms have been I don't know benching rowing a lot they heard a lot they go here yeah yeah okay and then they do some stuff and okay if somebody's pressing you for 30 minutes nonstop you'll feel things add the placebo effect to the mix voila and the compassionate touching effect to the mix it's nice to have someone pay attention you touch it for a little while and do small Tok people think there's some kind of technical deep physiological effect of the specific kind of sport massage in reality maybe in some injury recovery bloodflow profusion cases I think sport massage probably has its best uses when people are fucked up like you may need sport massage if you get injured or something's really fucking weird but if you're just a person who is let's say a back normal healthy back and you want it more G jacked adding two sessions per week of sport massage is a highly not Dependable way to get more jacked it's Dependable way to get someone to touch you which is nice but you know the thae girls down the street in the brothel they can do that for cheaper and more completely from what I've heard at my house and the tie girls being me and my multiple personalities some of them speak only Tha and I don't understand Tha it's so exotic it's um so it's po specifically you see a lot of bodybuilders talk about tissue work and throw in other got to do your fucking tissue work man this was I was missing on my last prep yeah I don't know what that means but neither do I fun fact cuz some people may say hey what about injuries that's part of recovery there was a recent systematic review in meta analysis looking at whether a physiotherapy a single physiotherapy session how that compared to multiple physiotherapy sessions as far as muscular skeletal disorders and not knocking anybody down here time to knock someone down yeah one session resulted in the same benefit as multiple session as far as muscular skeletal disorders so people that were fucked up so it turns out that education and getting a person more educated uh as part of that session maybe obviously case dependent right if you've broken your leg and you've like whatever don't hit me with the the random anecdote the education part may be more important than the actual visit and the let me Tinker with you and press this and press that and injuries happen randomly sometimes and you can't explain them or fix them the manual therapy thing used to be well we don't know scientifically yet what's happening but definitely things are happening and now the more the science kind of try to uncork it the more we're learning it's like not only do we not know what's happening scientifically evidentially it may not be happening at all it's kind of like people would say you know so like how would you explain ghosts like how come ghosts exist you're like I don't I don't think they exist show me a ghost I'll start proposing mechanisms but there was a lot of stuff in manual therapy about mechanism proposal for how like graston and all those the rubbing techniques work and it was like okay do these things actually promote recovery or growth or anything and most literature now has like n maybe probably not and oh looks like we don't need to suppose anatomical mechanisms whatsoever the worst one was K Tape for me I never kinesio tape but it looks so cool you look like a cyborg yeah like and you put it on it makes you feel like hey man my elbow's getting secured even though it's just duct tape on the side of your arm but even int massage intuitively I get it he's pressing on me something is happening blood flow muscle tissue but oh there's a tape I'm fixed on the skin on the skin as well anyways um put massages because they're expensive they require time and sometimes when you go to less experienced therapists that take the absolute piss can't even get you off that oh sorry yes play continue that you don't get the happy ending but you also get the oh I am sore from the massage I've had that yes tons people think that's a good thing though like yeah man the massage really beat me up like okay fucking know so because the only one pro you could make for sport massage is that oh does it help you relax if you go to your local spa whatever and there's somebody just robbing on you cool it's relaxation time that helps with recovery sure but the guy elbowing you bro that's me man I get I don't get massages often because I don't do like I don't I'm not into pain as as much as my porn search history would show complete opposite and it does um getting hurt is not fun for me and so when people are like they see me they're like clearly I have to fuck this guy up in a massage context it'll get the elbow going and I'm like can you do less they're like okay less less less by the time I've gotten to the the the less they they're just like putting their fingers on my skin gently and they're like you suck and I'm like hey I'm saving your hands for your next client that wants you to fuck them up but a lot of people do think like the harder the massages Yeah the more stuff now some people just like hard massages it makes them feel good and then your answer to them is like praise be to Jesus go get you a massage it's going to be awesome just don't start thinking it's going to like boost your muscle growth somehow no and if again if there's damage done there we could make the argument that or it boosts your muscle growth but it's now training yes externally delivered training someone beats you up for you yeah BJJ better than massage same idea yeah free massage from your friends e tier so we we haven't move one fell off we haven't moved much yeah that goes there SAA on the other hand although the literature doesn't show that it's going to magically accelerate recovery there are some more positive findings overall and as far as interference effect goes but I will go down the Avenue of is traditionally and this is okay anecdotal glasses on associated with relaxation more than some of the other modalities yes nobody relaxes in a cold tub yes so if you're going sauna with your buddies after the gym and from what I've seen here in the states some disgusting SAS in some like commercial gyms I'm like who goes in there people who look at other people's dicks yes if you go in there with your mate and you're like ah hard session sweat it out whatever touch the whole thing the whole thing that could be fine because you're essentially relaxing but again nothing magical we'll put that in the seat here does it interfere with muscle growth does heat exposure interfere with muscle growth not not uh anywhere near CWI cold water immersion okay somewhat M does it interfere somewhat no from so no effect no effect any beneficial effect there are there's some evidence as far as General Health goes but for muscle growth specifically no damn well fuck that who gives a shit about General Health I'm kidding yeah sauna is okay okay so sauna is better but as long as we're giving all the caveats if you hate the sauna like I fucking hate it I don't like to be hot it's it's fucking annoying I like to see tons of other 40 and 50 and 60y old naked dudes but I've got all kinds of websites for that so I don't need to be hot if it's uncomfortable for you it's probably not worth it mhm but if you like it no sweat not literally and then you're good to go do it just as long as you don't think it's some kind of magical super recovery formula might be a little okay for your recovery as long as you like doing it yeah as long as you're relaxing and as long as you as we say in the UK don't take the piss with it don't be in the S sweating for three hours and there's all types of I when I went to Russia for example we went to the real deal SAA with my aeri friend ilas who needed to show me how intense the Sona can get and kept making it harder and that it's like a manhood bullshit it's like who can drink the most beers who can jump their fucking truck over the river who can do the sa of the highest and not bitch about it like that that level of sauna probably there's no direct evidence but if you're there dehydrated and and like ready to faint probably not the best for Recovery or listen I can solve that one real quick when powerlifters Fighters when they SAA to make weight nobody feeling extra recovered after that you're for sure feeling way less recovered so definitely what is a good length of time for sauna 15 to 30 minutes something something relatively short like that off right okay yeah cuz the intensity of saunas can differ from country to country from whether you're dumping water on the coal and there blah blah blah so yeah sauna overall nothing extraordinary not a recovery modality that you should definitely go for if you love it and it's part of your culture okay do it with with some limits now moving on to actual things that help with recovery okay B tier and above B here now we are going to get a bit you know not so highp modality wise but Del loads which yes it's not a modality in the form that in the sense that you canot buy a D Lo and have it at your home but yes taking a D Lo when you're feeling very fatigued and doing less training or very easy training is a great way to help you feel more recovered and then approach training and be more recovered yes so the great thing about D loing or any kind of period of shorter training anywhere from a day to half a week to a week MH uh recovery day recovery half week D Lo all the way to two weeks of active rest if you need it basically can bring down your generation of new fatigue to zero MH and your body's normal natural fatigue reduction mechanisms are now like oh than fucking God they're shoveling shit and no one's pouring more shit into the pile they can get rid of all the shit for you and also because it's not full time off sometimes getting in and doing a little bit of light work technical work can improve your Technique but also a little bit of light work has been shown in physical rehabilitative science to improve the rates of recovery above and beyond doing nothing at all and there's at least a few studies on team sport things like soccer that I'm familiar with where active rest was better than passive rest people will say I don't like to deload I like to take a week off every eight weeks if they de loed theoretically they would recover a little better because of the slight movement but in your opinion pack if they just fucking hate going to the gym and they just need to unplug psychologically is it okay for people to just disappear for a week and call that basically a D Lo yes so if you're a serious lifter I would recommend some lifting as far as direct scientific evidence in the in the sense of okay de lo with some light lifting versus a week off we don't have any at the moment what we have is a study again from our lab where essentially the participants did either eight8 weeks so four weeks Del Lo in the form of a week off then four weeks um of training or nine weeks of um just continuous training without any breaks in that study in train individuals hypertrophy was the same for both groups so no harm done after taking a week off but anecdotally speaking cuz we all the literature that exists on D loads I had had the I have had the honor to be involved in it uh it's obviously been spearheaded by by different individuals but we've talked with plenty of very experienced coaches from and a lot of phds in sport Science and coaches were talking from Olympic um weightlifting at the Olympics sort of level coaches ifbb Pro coaches powerlifting world champion coaches and they all seem to recommend some form of light training within a week if you hate the gym why are you in the gym but like let's say you hate going for the light week because it doesn't feel hard and you don't feel like you're doing stuff you're not going to lose gains and that's why D loads are so high up in that tier you're gaining a bunch of recovery you're recovering iton you have time to catch up on whatever else you need to do in your life it's the only one that gives you time back yes the other one's like take time to foam roll fuck that take more time back for yourself for de lo amazing yeah and although we don't have any direct evidence yet we know that you're not going to gain less muscle you're gaining the same muscle and you could make the argument that over time if you're not running yourself into a wall and potentially getting injured and then having those three weeks where just the training is shitty and you feel bad and you're like what am I doing wrong like having that week off resetting and then attacking again could in theory lead to better results for those that look to maximize adaptations in the long term and in practice what I found is is you'll either deload or your body will Deo for you by getting you fucking hurt exactly so when you get real tired you can't progress well anymore and it's been at least four weeks a D Lo week at worst will have no effect on your gains but will reduce your fatigue and at best will buy you another 48 weeks of amazing training in which you have linear steady super awesome progress I think a lot of people who don't take D loads also deal with a lot of J training that kind of sucks yes you'll see this when people post on their various blogs and Vlogs like yeah man went into hamstrings today but things weren't clicking so I took it easy and you're like that is a D Lo if you knew that it happened every roughly six weeks you could just save yourself the time of driving to the fucking gym for sure if I don't want to drive to the gym can I just do some bodyweight exercises on a deal at week and maybe better than nothing yeah so as based on what we know thus far from talking to a bunch of very experienced people as long as you have an easy week of training or week off you're good now doing easy Atlas Stones all of a sudden or random movements that you've never done before and now all of a sudden you're like let me try this BJJ light workout that I've never done before on YouTube H maybe not the best idea but yeah you could do something at home strength athletes like to take their D Lo and replace the heavy with High Reps but lighter and actually cost them even more fatigue like ah this didn't work so you would say on a D Lo no training that's trying to push you to become better at anything no overloading training of any kind even if it's different No it should just feel as if you did some light activity great yeah and we we'll put DLo in the a tier oh there's no B tier no B tier no we're upgrading them after the chat that's sweet but last but not least we are going to put food and sleep into the S tier we're not going to get into why sleep and food are good but I'm pretty sure that everybody's aware is there anything you want to add on food and sleep yeah super quick okay sleep is your body takes a lot of time which is not mobile anyway because you're not a nocturnal creature your body puts you down and makes you go to sleep somewhere safe and warm From Evolution and it really does use that opportunity to fix a lot of shit in your brain in your body sleep is is the theoretically and practically most recovery time most recovery emphasized time your body will take any 24-hour cycle and multiple consistent findings on sleep literature shows that if you're under slept chronically fuck Sports fuck getting jacked you're not doing any of that shit it is going to cost you big time on the food side well you know you're kind of made of food and all of your recovery process processes I know that sounds crazy all of your recovery processes are fueled by food and if you are in a hypocaloric condition not enough calories your body's like recovery has to now be balanced with survival so I'm going to turn the recovery down a little bit just to make sure I have enough to take care of the system but if you have an ISO or hypercaloric condition enough food coming in your body's like fuck yeah recover away and it really prioritize that one last little quick thing getting a large literally switches turns on your parasympathetic recovery function of your autonomic nervous system and turns down the sympathetic fighter flight one big meal already begins to Recovery in a really big way y so that's all the thetical bullshit I mean you you since you touched on it like if we look at um studies that have looked at limited energy availability and muscle gain or even um met analytic data on the on calorie deficit and muscle gain things don't look great after a certain point if you're let's say um below 500ish calories uh as as far as the deficit goes so 500 calories below your maintenance you're not going to strink all of a sudden because obviously what um what you do with training and protein intake and stuff matters but if you're not eating enough or you're not eating enough protein that's where there is enough uh data for you to be like ah okay um actually I may be losing gains here not even making gains and with protein specifically being around 1.5 grams per kilo of body weight is a safe bed which is not that much protein and yeah being doing all these YOLO cuts and all random stuff that you see random Trends and then fasting but being in a deficit while fasting for discipline and whatever fasting for Recovery yeah those things can actually impair your recovery but truly last but not least and that ties in everything we've talked about now Stress Management and seeing what you can do outside the gym in terms of your own life and your your general stress whatever you can manage being on top of that the same way you see some people be on top of all the jargon and they'll buy the latest CBD spray because Conor McGregor advertised it or they'll form roll they'll do the S and they're they're like yeah I got to be dedicated man three hours of that per week and then outside the gym you know they're not I don't know seeking therapy they're not checking themselves and seeing okay how am I able to manage my stress better managing stress can be in my opinion a game Cher for Recovery that often goes H it's complex to address so people put in the side and they're like I can buy this device and just uh roll it on top of my body and that will cover me very few people talk about this but it's Ultra important chronically high stress be it physical or mental until your body doesn't really care MH chronically elevates catabolic hormones like cortisol degrades catabolic hormones like testosterone but if you get regular massive reductions in stress you are in a environment opposite of that physiologically that's a real good thing the more you are in a very low stress situation the more you're parasympathetic de-stressing system can activate the more it is active and the more recovery you get if you go to work for eight hours you're yelling at stock Brokers firing your secretary typical typical day right but you're really jazzed up the whole time and under a lot of stress your fight or flight that entire time you have low grade fight ORF flight response from your body your body is not prioritizing recovery and adaptation and getting a jacked nearly as much as if you chill down on the couch watch Netflix eight high protein foods every four hours that's a big deal it's such a big deal that uh Bulgaria you're familiar with a country former pretty much from Bulgaria Soviet there you go during the Soviet times the bulgarians had no interest in civil rights or people's enjoyment whatsoever this brutal oppressive Communist Regime good but good good all is well but um they did have a professional weightlifting team that was the best in the world by many measures at least in conversation and those guys spent the vast majority of their time at a training center away from the city getting multiple hot meals per day multiple massages per day opportunities for relaxation that were 100% of their day outside of the two training sessions they did and actually they got a chance to visit with people that would take care of them sexually and so they had Recreation planned as their entire day other than training the Bulgarian government did not do that because it was nice to its athletes it didn't like its athletes at all didn't like anybody but that's the shit that works if you only think of yourself as a machine as an athlete the absolute Pinnacle of sport achievement of recovery of getting jacked occurs when 100% of your mental and physical effort is spent getting jacked in the gym and the rest of your day is spent at Le like literally in a Leisure State yes that's a fucking big deal to just realize and then it turns out that if you look at what a professional bodybuilder is you can be a professional bodybuilder by having a pro card but there are many people who have Pro cards that they coach clients they run their online business and it is no longer very true to call them as true professional bodybuilders because a professional race car driver is a person that lives race car driving they're taking trips between destinations they're doing track work they're doing simulator work they're doing some shit all the fucking time if you're a professional bodybuilder what you really should be doing is training hard as fuck getting all your cardio in getting all your meals in and then the rest should be as little as possible but we forget that sort of thing we look at how come Ronnie Coleman was so jacked but like oh but this guy who's saying that works 60 hours a week that's a fucking problem the other thing and let me know if this is uh something that you can uh find some time for is the there are two big things for me as far as Stress Management that come up repeatedly one is the more work you do and the more stress you get under the more you have to recover from and the less recovery bandwidth you get for everything else like getting your workouts in and getting jacked so understand that you have a maximum recoverable volume for bullshit and work responsibilities if you have two jobs and take care of five pets and have six children at home you're simply not going to be a to biohack your way into getting the same results everyone else's so at some point you have to say if I'm really really really interested in getting jacked this summer I wanted to have like two jobs this summer but I really want to get jacked let me just get one summer job yes part-time it'll just be way way better and the other thing that comes to mind is what are you doing to d-stress because some people have let's say two people have a similar amount of stress from work they both work eight hours a day the boss yells at them continuously for eight hours they come home one guy is choosing activities that do not distress them exciting YouTube exciting movies engaging in the comments uh and getting pissed at political posts it's fun but it doesn't relax you and so when you're at home off of work and after training you're not relaxing much whereas the other person they train they work and then they spend the other time doing relaxing activities consuming you tube and reels that are just like ah like one of these you all dogs playing little Bulldog puppies oh my God they're so cute shit like that hanging out with people that you like light-hearted humor cuddling on the couch watching a documentary or two that person that gets the same level of wound up but can wind it down is going to have a huge advantage over someone that gets the same level of wound up but they never can quite uncork it so first thing is don't put too much on your plate the second thing is for whatever you do put on your plate make sure you are doing some Stress Management on the other end to bring the stress down and last thing sorry I'm ranting at you a lot of people and this is something Dr James Hoffman one of my colleagues has said this is one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard as far as um how quickly you can get to the truth of something It Go typically when people think recovery they go what do I add to my program what am I add to my lifestyle to recover better he goes people are thinking about that literally backwards it's what do I remove and so a lot of people will say I got to recover more after work I know I'm all jazzed up after work like okay um let's schedule me in to do go do some yoga three days a week I'm gonna take the train up town yeah I'm gonna sit in a fucking yoga class and be in painful positions maybe I relax maybe I don't but it's relaxation for it's it's it's it's in my schedule written down as relaxing and it might not be and they add the yoga I need a meditation app and that's all great stuff if it relaxes you but if it doesn't I would say Netflix and food is kind of undefeated as far as a recovery modality pack I've been rapping for a long time what did I say that was wrong no nothing and that's that's the issue here is that just relaxing and um mindlessly scrolling on reals on on Instagram or YouTube or watching Netflix is often associated with being lazy so a lot of people that consume the information that we put out they're like okay but I'm into science I watch Mike there's definitely something that I'm missing out that I know more than the average individual I can do more I can do more but anecdotally speaking what do you think led to a massive increase in performance in some world champion I'm talking like best best in the world powerlifters uh in the last three years so this was this came off um after some discussions as part of our interview studies it was unrelated to the topic of the studies but what do you think um actually led to some of the best power LS in the world having their best performance and their best training sessions as far as recovery goes I don't know tell me it was the covid lockdowns fuck that's so brilliant yeah so like a lot of people ended up oh I'm not in the office anymore uh the world is kind of on pause and all of a sudden oh things are feeling 10 times better so much better and we're talking about individuals that are already at the absolute top and still manage to climb a bit higher so as you said removing things and just doing the plain non sexy non oh you found the hack that nobody knows sort of thing and just spending some time with your family going for a light walk watching some stuff engaging in a hobby that you have that is how you recover mentally and if you're also being you know leisurely physically as well not by buying the latest BS product yeah anecdotally very anecdotally you'll get like a on AR two archetypes meeting in a gym one is like skinny incel hard Gainer computer engineer for his job Reddit for his not job worrywart high anxiety type skinny Harry Potter looking motherfucker and you'll have an ifb Pro bodybuilder next to him and this guy will strike up a conversation the bodybuilder cool he's a sets reps Cadence blah blah on the body like half the stuff he's like I haven't really ever thought about that like this is what works for me and like I get it the bodybuilder is not the kind of person that worries much he does his training he thinks about it a little bit not even much he goes home he takes a couple blunt hits he plays on PS5 for a while he takes a nap he wakes up has another meal couple blun heads repeats the process goes to sleep wake up some wakes up the next day and then it's time to go train again while the other guy is coding and then he's on Reddit and then he's up to ODOT hours looking for the next recovery modal you just found your problem right there yeah exactly couldn't have said it better cuz like culturally there's a mismatch where if you see someone jacked you're like what are they doing to get that and they do some stuff they do steroids they do hard lifting they do a lot of meals they get lots of sleep which is more like not doing than doing but people forget that a lot of these people who are the biggest most jacked people in the world have the easiest time relaxing you ever seen Ronnie Coleman visibly stressed I don't think I've ever seen stress in his entire life even even when working as a police officer you he look like Rass guy today so Stress Management is huge huge and it's it's not as sexy and it sometimes requires a lot of work cuz people are stressed for all sorts of reasons and opening that kind of worms for some people is like ah I'd rather go for the quick fix yes yes insert meme yeah it can be a lot of nasty stuff in there when you start to look into your own mind got to do it at some point maybe or you could just die with no introspection at all and that ladies and gentlemen is the real end of the video leave you with these thoughts"

    "transcript": "in this video I'm going to explain how to build muscle in five levels of increasing complexity starting with the most basic explanation and getting more detailed as we go now in preparing this video I consulted with a number of different experts including a professor in muscle metabolism an industry leader in the field of biomechanics and an active researcher in the field of strength and conditioning I'm also a pro natural bodybuilder myself and I've been studying the science behind getting jacked for over a decade while coaching people from around the globe and just for fun I'd like you to comment below which level you got to before you started zoning out or getting lost [Music] all right so building muscle is actually pretty simple all you really need to do is lift weights and eat protein protein of course being the macronutrient found in foods like fish chicken meat Dairy beans lentils and protein powders and when you weight train your muscles start to think well if we're going to keep lifting these heavy weights I'd better start to get some bigger muscles to make this easier this is called an Adaptive response and it's kind of like when you play guitar your fingertips start to get harder and roales as an Adaptive response to pressing against the strings it hurts at first but then it gets easier as you build the thicker skin layer however lifting weights isn't quite enough on its own to build muscle in order to build something you need building blocks and when it comes to muscle the building blocks are called amino acids which you get by eating protein so when you lift weights you're telling the muscle it needs to get bigger and when you eat protein you're giving the muscle the building blocks it needs to actually [Music] grow so in reality it's probably not quite good enough to just lift weights and eat protein to get really solid results for example if you're lifting the exact same weight for the exact same reps 2 years from now that you lifted today that probably won't be good enough to keep the muscle growing sure you'll see some decent growth at the beginning because you've never lifted any weight before but soon enough that weight will no longer be challenging enough to present a sufficient stimulus for your muscle to continue growing this is why we need to expand the lift weights part to lift weights with an emphasis on Progressive overload now the technical definition of progressive overload is the gradual increase of stress on the muscles during weight training but we can simply think of it as just increasing some training parameter over time so from workout to workout you want to add a little bit of weight or add an extra rep using the same weight for example let's say you're trying to grow your biceps rather than doing three sets of 10 reps with the same weight week after week and month after month it'd be much more effective to do three sets of 10 reps in week 1 three sets of 11 in week two three sets of 12 and week three and then in week four you can go back back to 10 reps again but this time add a little more weight now at a certain point you may not be able to increase the weight or reps each and every time and that's okay there are still other ways to apply Progressive overload such as by adding an extra set with the same reps and the same weight or even by doing something as simple as controlling the negative a little better or feeling a stronger mind muscle connection where you more consciously feel the muscle squeezing and stretching as you lift or swapping out for a new exercise and starting that overloading process again also on the nutrition side we can do quite a bit better than just saying eat protein so to be more specific the latest research shows that Landing between 1.6 to 2.2 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day so about 0.7 to 1 gram per pound is a good Target for maximizing muscle gain for example if you weigh 165 lbs or 75 kilos you'd want to be eating somewhere in the range of 120 to 165 g of protein per day for General muscle building now there may be some advantage in going a bit higher in certain Advanced situations but this is a sufficient range for most now if you're very high in body fat the grams per unit body weight approach won't work as well so let's say you're 300 lb you don't really need 300 g of protein per day so in that case I simply prefer to use 1 g of protein per centimeter in height because it works independently of body fat percentage so let's say you're 5'9 or about 175 cm tall 175 g of protein would be plenty for you it's not a perfect system but it'll get you in the right Ballpark and while there is some evidence to suggest that spacing your protein across 3 to five meals throughout the day might be more ideal if that suggestion holds true it's certainly much less important than simply hitting a daily protein Target in fact contrary to Common belief training is a much more powerful contributor to muscle growth in diet and by quite a long shot so while it is true that a caloric Surplus will drive muscle growth more effectively and dietary manipulations like protein timing can have some impact I'm going to focus the remaining levels on maximizing the muscle response through resistance [Music] training so focusing on Progressive overload is smart but it still leaves a lot to be desired in the gym for example it doesn't tell us how hard we should push it or how many sets we should do or how many reps we should do or how heavy we should be lifting so next I want to take a quick look at what the research says about the so-called acute training variables factors like effort volume intensity exercise selection and frequency now I think effort is the most fundamental variable for growth because no matter how much you optimize all the other stuff if you aren't pushing it hard enough the muscle simply won't grow at least not optimally now there's currently a raging debate within the scientific Community about exactly how hard we should push each set a relatively small group of experts insists that all sets should be taken all the way to muscular failure defined as an inability to complete another rep despite maximum effort but I'd say that the mainstream scientific consensus is that it isn't necessary to take sets all the way to failure but you do need to be pretty close you shouldn't be leaving more than two or three reps in the tank for most of your sets now of course there are a few exceptions relieving five or more reps in the tank does make sense for recovery especially when training primarily for strength but as a general rule most of your sets should be pretty close to failure so you do need to push it hard maybe Harder Than You Think up next volume technically refers to the amount of work you do and this was historically calculated as the number of sets times the number of reps times the amount of load but as of 2015 most practitioners began to think of volume simply as the number of hard sets you do now over the last few years it's become a popular meme to think of volume as the quote primary driver of hypertrophy and if I ever said this I no longer think it's the case rather than more volume leading to more growth what we instead see is a sort of inverted U Trend where more volume leads to more growth only up to a point past which further increases don't do anything extra and then at a certain point adding more volume seems to be counterproductive so there's this volume Sweet Spot which seems to be a bit different for everyone and I find a lot of people are already doing more volume than they really need and would probably benefit more by reducing their volume and focusing more on effort and execution but the main point is that you should experiment and figure out what dose of volume gives you the best balance of gains and Recovery still based on what we know from the current science something around 10 to 20 sets per body part per week seems to be a good range for most people and most muscles so for example if you're running an upper lower split that has you in the gym four days a week your chest volume might look something like this with six hard sets for your chest on Monday and six hard sets for your chest on Thursday totaling 12 hard sets for the week okay next we need to cover intensity which despite its popular conflation with effort technically refers to how heavy the weight is you can either lift heavy weights for low reps or light weights for High Reps but what's the best for muscle growth well it turns out that as long as you're taking sets sufficiently close to failure you can maximize hypertrophy using High Reps or low reps or a combination of both research has shown that reps as low as three and Reps as high as 30 all cause similar muscle growth however there does seem to be a limit to how light you can go new data shows that when you lift weights lighter than 20% of your one rep max you do see significantly less growth but the average rep count subjects got with that load was 67 reps not a very practical way to train regardless so the traditional 6 to 12 rep zone is kind of a myth in the sense that research shows you can go well outside that range and still grow fine as long as you're training close to muscular failure still I think there is some value in that 6 to 12 range because once you start dipping down below six reps you can risk unnecessary strain on your joints and it can be practically more difficult to accumulate enough volume and the more often you go above 12 reps the more you risk just burning yourself out as higher rep sets are harder to recover from so for practical purposes I suggest splitting it up like this with the majority of your sets coming in that 6 to 12 or maybe 15 Zone while having smaller chunks dedicated to lower Reps for continued strength progression and higher Reps for stimulative variety now I think exercise selection and execution is just as much an art as it is a science sure I do tend to favor multi-joint compound movements like squats presses and rows in my own training because they give you more hypertrophic bang for your buck by activating large amounts of muscle Mass while promoting more efficient total body strength gain and while I definitely think mastering these basic compound movements is important single joint isolation exercises certainly have their place especially when it comes to targeting smaller muscles like the biceps rear delts side delts and abs which can be overpowered if you focus on compound lifts exclusively luckily when it comes to muscle growth there are no mandatory exercises and so after mastering the basics it's once again important to experiment with different movements and movement variations to figure out what works best for you and and your body's mechanics now when it comes to frequency it seems like most people have flipped from thinking that you should only train each body part once a week on a split that looks something like this otherwise you're going to overtrain and melt your muscle away to these days most people thinking that if you train on a bro split like this you're never going to make any gains at all because science in reality the latest research actually shows that frequency in and of itself likely plays a relatively minor role in muscle growth and the latest studies show similar results between hitting a body part once a week and three plus times per week how however I still generally recommend hitting a muscle at least twice a week and I do prefer splits like upper lower and full body over the traditional body part split because they typically allow for more volume per week and higher quality volumes per workout still as long as you've got all the other variables in place are recovering properly and being consistent over time this is an area of programming that probably deserves less of the spotlight than it tends to get and then there are other training variables like rest periods lifting Tempo and advanced intensity techniques that make up a relatively smaller piece of the puzzle and rather than go into detail on these I'll just link a few videos on them down [Music] below okay so with Progressive overload and the main acute training variables in mind at this point I'd like to get a bit more granular and take a closer look at what's actually driving muscle growth physiologically so in 2010 Dr Brad shenfeld published a landmark paper with over 500 citations that introduced the three Factor model of muscle hypertrophy this model proposed that there are three main things driving muscle growth grow mechanical tension muscle damage and metabolic stress now the very short version is that mechanical tension is the type of force that tries to stretch a muscle fiber one way to visualize this is like a tug of war as each side pulls tension is generated in the Rope so you can think of it like not only are the people pulling on the rope but the Rope is also pulling back on the people similar in the muscle where tension is passively created when the muscle is stretched and tension is actively created during contraction when actin molecules are pulled by meas and heads and as of now tension remains absolutely Undisputed as the primary driver of hypertrophy within the scientific community at large next muscle damage is basically exactly what it sounds like physical damage to the muscle like micro tears and other cellular disruptions and you can observe this under a microscope where you see that the normal pattern in muscle can be seriously disrupted after training now some believe that this type of damage is at least partly responsible for the delayed onset muscle soreness that you can feel in the days following training although the soreness phenomenon is no doubt caused by a number of factors and still isn't fully understood Still For Years many people have just assumed that getting sore should be the goal of training since soreness comes from muscle damage and muscle damage causes muscle growth but the latest science shows that that first claim is questionable and the second claim is most likely not true of course the most common sense way to think about this is that running a marathon would cause tons of muscle damage but wouldn't do anything good for muscle growth in fact a review paper from wacken colleagues pointed out that if anything damage in this context would seem to decrease muscle growth and even in a weight training context damage doesn't seem to be doing much good the study from domson colleagues argued that damage doesn't even correlate with hypertrophy over the long run as shown in the figure here early on in a training program you see a huge amount of damage this could be why you get so sore when starting a new routine and while there is an Associated early spike in muscle protein synthesis the vast majority of that synthesis is directed toward repairing damaged muscle tissue rather than building new muscle tissue from scratch and it's only after that damage decreases that muscle protein syn is is directed toward new muscle hypertrophy and while folks Playing devil's advocate could argue well studies show that Ecentric training causes more muscle damage and studies also show that Ecentric training causes more muscle growth I would simply respond that correlation doesn't imply causation and it seems more likely to me that the extra growth that you see from Ecentric overloading could simply be coming from the fact that you can simply overload the muscle more heavily during an Ecentric contraction causing more tension in the muscle now I should say that if we're being really honest we don't actually understand muscle damage all that well even the methods of Simply measuring muscle damage have been contested by prominent researchers so the bottom line is that any theory that uses muscle damage to explain muscle growth is speculative at best and unfeasible at worst but what about metabolic stress well metabolic stress refers to the accumulation of metabolites like lactate and hydrogen ions and the muscle hypoxia that often follows weight training and it's often associated with the massive skin tearing pumps that you get from high rep workouts so if muscle damage and it's ensuing soreness is unlikely to be driving muscle growth surely the pump and its Associated metabolic stress must be doing something I mean even Arnold seemed to recognize this the greatest feeling you can get in a gym or the most satisfying feeling you can get in the gym is the pump your muscles get a really tight feeling like your skin is going to explode any minute you know it's really tight it's like somebody blowing air into into your muscle it just blows up and it feels different it feels fantastic and well while the pump does feel good and certainly can make training more enjoy and perhaps even provide some feedback that you're actually hitting the muscle that you're trying to Target it most likely isn't driving hypertrophy because there are just too many examples of where the relationship between metabolic stress and muscle growth breaks down shorter rest periods cause more metabolic stress but significantly less muscle growth than longer rest periods note that there's a footnote in the description Box about this partial range of motion causes more metabolic stress but often less muscle growth in full range of motion training all the way to failure causes more metabolic stress but at best results in equal muscle growth to stopping a few reps shy of failure and Blood Flow Restriction Training causes tons of metabolic stress but doesn't enhance hypertrophy on its own and doesn't even work in conjunction with training unless the training methods are highly suboptimal and even in this case it still seems to point back to tension when I spoke with one of the authors of this popular Blood Flow Restriction study he pointed out that any benefit seems to be tension related would you argue that the impact of bfr essentially leads back to just creating more tension in the muscle like do you think it still goes back to tension yeah it's like it's just bfr is it's like cheating 20 reps extra in a sense it's the it's the same effect you just it just happens earlier so consensus is converging on tension and perhaps tension alone as being the primary driver of muscle growth and so it should be the primary goal of our training to maximize tension above anything else so how do we do that well the practical application is actually quite simple you need to apply Progressive tension increases to the MUSC itself this means we need to lift with good consistent technique while using the acute training variables and Progressive overload to push the level of intramuscular tension up over time also paying attention to things like the Mind muscle connection at least on certain exercises and Ecentric control should also help as those aspects of lifting have been shown to increase intramuscular [Music] tension okay so we know that mechanical tension is the main thing driving muscle growth but what happens next how do we get from a mechanical stimulus like tension to a biochemical signal that commands the muscle to grow well Dr tromlin explained this to me in terms of blocks of dominoes he said that when one thing gets activated it passes on the signal to the next thing and the next thing and so on but if you're smart you don't just build one chain of dominoes you build out all these side chains so that they fall in a bunch of different directions and it's the same thing with muscle growth there isn't just one pathway with one outcome but rather many different interconnected Pathways with many different Downstream effects effects so with that in mind let's start at the top all right so we lift a weight heavy enough that it creates active mechanical tension within the muscle this is called the stimulus the stimulus is sensed by mechan sensors which sort of feel that the muscle is being pulled into tension and pass that signal on now based on the latest research it isn't perfectly clear exactly which molecules are doing this sensing but the top candidates include camir which are collections of proteins that sit in the muscle fiber membrane and are responsible for holding muscle fibers together and transferring force between muscle fibers during contraction there's also Titan which as a fun fact is actually the largest protein we've ever discovered in humans and because it runs parallel to the muscle fiber itself could theoretically be responsible for sensing mechanical changes like stretching but probably only at long muscle lengths and then there's filamin which bind to the famous actin proteins that slide during contraction making them a really good candidate for sensing tension and for the record I read through the latest paper on all this sensing stuff from 2018 and I'll just say this area of research is not well understood yet to quote the author's directly conclusively identifying major hypertrophy stimuli and their sensors is one of the big remaining questions in exercise physiology still we can paint the rest of the picture with a broad brush for now from the mechanos sensors a signal gets sent to a beast mode molecule called mtor which is a major regulator of cellular growth in general not just in muscle tissue it's also implicated in many cancers because of its responsibility in making tissues bigger from there mtor goes to the nucleus and tells the DNA Machinery to produce a messenger RNA strand which you can think of as a set of blueprints for building new muscle those blueprints are sent to a ribosome which is like a muscle protein building Factory that manufactures a string of amino acids based on the blueprint from the MRNA in a process known as translation and this step is what we're actually talking about when we say muscle protein synthesis now through this translation process many different proteins will be synthesized some of which will be the big contractile proteins that make us more jacked others will be more ribosomal proteins or mtor proteins themselves so anabolic growth potential remains high in the future now if this rate of synthesis exceeds the rate of breakdown protein balance is said to be positive and in that case new contractile proteins are incorporated into muscle fibers resulting in what's called myofibrillar hypertrophy leading to increased muscle size overall but all of that is really just one string of dominoes there's also this other path that's triggered by amino acids in the protein we eat in this case amino acids are transported inside the cell and the amino acid Lucine also activates mtor now for the record we seem to need about 3 G of Lucine to stimulate mtor which can be found in about 20 to 20 G of high quality protein although some research has shown greater anabolic responses with higher protein doses so it may be possible to crank mtor activity higher with more Lucine but regardless it's important to realize that the stimulative impact of Lucine is much shorter than the stimulative impact of weight training and so for maximum mtor stimulation you need both training and Lucine with Lucine essentially complementing the stimulative effects of weightlifting then the other eight essential amino acids there's nine in total when you include Lucine make their way to the the ribosome where they're used as the fundamental building blocks for creating new muscle now another pathway that I'll briefly mention is that of testosterone now even though modifying testosterone within the natural range plays a relatively minor role in muscle growth when you inject highdose testosterone the hormone crosses the muscle cell membrane and either binds to an androgen receptor directly or is converted to DHT which then binds to the Androgen receptor and then that complex enters the nucleus and tells the DNA to start cranking out more blueprints turning up that muscle protein synthetic process even more now if I were actually discussing muscle growth with an expert there are a lot of other things I'd want to discuss I'd want to at least mention sarcoplasmic hypertrophy so far we've been focusing on myofibrillar hypertrophy so the growth of actual contractile tissue but there's some new solid evidence supporting so-called sarcoplasmic hypertrophy which is the growth of all the other stuff inside the muscle fiber like glycogen organel and other non-contractile proteins then I might speculate that higher rep and higher volume training might bias the muscle towards sarcoplasmic growth but then the expert depending on how open they are to guesswork might shut that down for lacking evidence I'd also definitely want to talk about myonuclear addition the idea that all this muscle protein synthetic stuff still seems to be limited by the number of nuclei or command centers that you have in your muscle cells to begin with and so when satellite cells that surround the muscle cell Like Satellites donate their nuclei that could theoretically allow the muscle cell to crank out more new muscle protein and build more muscle but then the expert might push back that that theory is actually pretty speculative and we can't even rightly assume that nuclei are in fact limiting factors for hypertrophy until we get more science in our hands and then a curious bystander might ask why does any of this matter anyway what's the point of this level of research maybe the expert would respond by saying something like knowledge having value for its own sake or maybe they'd point out a few of its many medical applications such as an understanding sarcopenia or muscular distrophy or maybe they'd say that they're trying to figure all this stuff out just in case there's a new pathway that can actually feedback into training recommendations or maybe we'll be able to use this research to develop an exercise pill someday that creates the same cellular effect is weight training without having to spend nearly as much time in the gym a sort of steroid without side effects that could start development 50 years down the road but since I'm getting well over my own head at this point I think I'm going to leave it there for this one if you guys made it this far please let me know by commenting I'm ready for level six and I'll see if I can make that happen in another video as new research comes in as always don't forget to leave me a thumbs up if you enjoyed the video subscribe if you haven't already and I'll see you guys all here in the next one"

    "transcript": "Hey everyone! Just wanted to explain the change\nof scenery. Usually, we film these videos in a studio, but we\u2019re gonna be filming\nfrom my house from now on. Hair check, hair check. I\u2019m gonna stress about one thing\ntoday is my hair. Alright! Aging is inescapable, for now anyway. And aging itself encompasses\na lot of physiology. Some aspects of aging are hard to picture and are the topic of ongoing research,\nbut one that we know quite a bit about is muscle. But muscle is complex. Not only is\nit always adapting to how we use it, but it changes multiple times over the course of\nour lives. Today, we\u2019ll learn about how our muscles change from the time we\u2019re just\na fetus, to our last mortal moments. Before we get too deep in the weeds here, we need\nto clarify what we mean by muscle. Some of you may remember back from episode one that\nmuscle is one of our four distinct types of tissue along with nervous, epithelial, and\nconnective tissue. Each type of muscle has a different function, and there are three\ntypes.\u00a0We\u2019ve got two types of muscle that we control involuntarily: the special cardiac\nmuscle in our hearts and smooth muscle around our blood vessels and certain organs. We don\u2019t\nconsciously contract our heart muscles. Thank goodness, that would be exhausting.\u00a0The focus\nof this episode though is skeletal muscle, the type of muscle that lets you move your\nbody. Skeletal muscle is the most massive group of tissue in your body making up for\na serious chunk of your body weight, so where does it come from? This tissue is one of the\nfirst ones formed while you\u2019re still an embryo, so that\u2019s where our journey begins.\nIn your early days as an embryo, your cells divide into three distinct layers \u2014 the\nendoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Literally the inner, middle, and outer layers. These\nlayers become the different tissues of your body, and it\u2019s the mesoderm that we\u2019re\ninterested in. It becomes the tissues of your cardiovascular system, reproductive system,\nconnective tissue, and skeletal muscle.\u00a0During development, you have cells in the mesoderm\nlayer called myoblasts \u2014 these things are cells that are dedicated to becoming muscle\nfibers.\u00a0 Myoblasts grow and replicate until they encounter a certain chemical that gets\nthem to start the process of turning into proper muscle. After they encounter that chemical,\nif they bump into another myoblast, they\u2019ll start linking together into chains of myoblast\ncells.\u00a0 Now, one thing that makes skeletal muscle fibers unique compared to cardiac or\nsmooth muscle is how it has multiple nuclei in each fiber.\u00a0That\u2019s because during this\nnext stage as an embryo, myoblasts fuse together into structures called myotubes then they\nditch their individual cell membranes as they fuse into one fiber. Each myoblast had a nucleus,\nso the myotubes, as well as mature muscle fibers, have multiple nuclei too. Some of\nthose myoblasts don\u2019t differentiate though, and they hang around as satellite cells, a\ntype of cell that sometimes gets called muscle stem cells. These things are super useful.\nOur mature muscle fibers don\u2019t divide like other cells do, but satellite cells can divide\nand grow if our muscles are injured. Although, that statement comes with a lot of it depends\nattached to it. There\u2019s quite a bit that can influence how those satellite cells work.\nAt this point in the journey, you are a human that\u2019s alive in the world, crawling around\nwith about six hundred muscles, eating mashed bananas or Cheerios or whatever they feed\nbabies these days. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t hang out with any. From the time you\u2019re\na newborn to your younger years, you keep roughly the same number of muscle fibers,\nbut each one gets bigger because of those satellite cells. This muscle cell growth is\ncalled hypertrophy and it explains the vast majority of muscle growth that happens in\nyour body.\u00a0If you\u2019ve lifted weights before, you might\u2019ve heard that term thrown around\na bit in reference to those hashtag gains. And it\u2019s true, your muscles can hypertrophy\nas a result of a weight lifting routine. But hypertrophy also means an increase in any\ncell size.\u00a0So your fat cells can hypertrophy too, that kind of thing. Plenty of research\nhas investigated the possibility of muscle hyperplasia, or growing new muscle fibers,\nbut at this point in our knowledge of muscle,\u00a0it seems like our muscles grow mostly because\nour existing fibers get bigger.\u00a0Weightlifting aside, at this point in your lifecycle, your\nmuscles are growing. After a few years, puberty happens and your muscles grow again. And your\nmuscles keep growing in size and strength until about your twenties and maybe thirties.\nIt seems kind of silly to say this, but every body is different. Your body is still awesome\nregardless of when your muscle mass peaks. I also included that maybe in that last line\nbecause nothing special happens to your body at the stroke of midnight when you turn thirty.\nAlthough that was when I got my first grey hair. As life goes on, and you creep into\nyour thirties, this is about when aging starts to have its effect on your muscles. Sometime\nafter your thirties, you\u2019ll lose about one to two percent muscle mass every year.\u00a0By\nage 70, you\u2019re looking at twenty five to thirty percent muscle loss from your peak.\nThis aging-associated muscle loss is called sarcopenia, which involves a few long term\nprocesses that all happen at the same time. It\u2019s kind of a weird, in-between term that\nsometimes refers to a disease but also just being a thing that happens as a result of\nage-related changes.\u00a0Unfortunately, because there\u2019s so much happening at once, it\u2019s\nhard to figure out what causes muscle loss, and therefore how we can fix it. It involves\nboth changes in function and physical changes that both influence each other. Some of it\nis influenced by your nervous system. As you age, the nerves that control your skeletal\nmuscles reorganize themselves. We start to lose type 2 muscle fibers, which are fast\ntwitch fibers that let us generate power, and start to rely on the slow twitch, type\n1 fibers.\u00a0Part of that involves losing connections between nerves and type 2 muscle fibers. With\nless muscle working together for any given movement, and switching to weaker fibers in\ngeneral, your strength decreases and eventually, so does the size of your muscles. Muscle aging comes with all kinds of changes in the composition\nof muscle. We also see an increase in the fat and connective tissue between and around\nmuscle fibers. Plus, we see a decrease in our muscle\u2019s ability to repair itself. Part\nof this is because we don't make as much new protein to go into those muscles. We also\nsee fewer of those important satellite cells, again, cells that become skeletal muscles,\nso we can\u2019t take advantage of their repair and regeneration abilities like we used to.\nAnd then we start losing mitochondria. If you remember back to our mitochondria episode,\ncertain cell types have more mitochondria than others,\u00a0and skeletal muscle has a lot\nfor its size.\u00a0 They need to make quite a bit of energy to do so much work, so in order\nfor muscle to work properly, they depend on functioning mitochondria.\u00a0And when muscle\nmitochondria don\u2019t work as well, neither do your muscles. We\u2019re still not totally\nsure why mitochondria stop working as well, but we think it has to do with slight tweaks\nin gene regulation, or how your body turns certain genes on or off. There are a few other\nreasons for muscle loss as well like increased general inflammation, hormonal changes, and\nwe just tend to be less active as we get older. So it won\u2019t come as a surprise that the\nmost effective treatments for preventing muscle loss due to normal aging include a combination\nof nutrition and exercise. I know I just spent the last two minutes talking about how your\nmuscle wastes away as you get older, but I\u2019ll leave you with a bit of hope. Exercise is\none of the most powerful things you can do to maintain health as you get older, and you\ncan see gains from exercise long into life.\u00a0A handful of studies have shown that adults\nbetween age sixty and eighty can improve their aerobic fitness by twenty to thirty percent\nwith exercise.\u00a0 One study even showed that seniors in their nineties could get stronger\nand see thigh muscle hypertrophy with strength training. This becomes a huge deal when it\ncomes to staying independent and avoiding falls.\u00a0Studies use different styles or prescriptions\nof exercise, but they usually include some kind of weight lifting component. Those treatments\nhelp reduce muscle loss by improving those satellite cells, preventing further loss of\nnervous connections, and making more mitochondria. But I doubt you\u2019re really gonna care how many\nmitochondria you have when you\u2019re that old. You\u2019re probably more concerned with stuff\nlike balance and day to day tasks. Thankfully, strength training helps with that too.\u00a0Going\ninto the future, researchers are working on identifying the finer details behind sarcopenia\nand how to best treat it, maybe with drugs or other strategies. In the meantime, I\u2019m\nstrangely motivated to lift all of a sudden. Thinking about frailty and mortality can make\npeople feel uneasy, I know, but part of what makes life so special is the fact that it\u2019s\nfragile. Ultimately, it\u2019s what makes our lives human. Thanks for watching this episode\nof Seeker Human, I\u2019m Patrick Kelly."

    "transcript": "is it possible to build muscle fast it took me years to gain some size and eventually my gain stopped alog together instead of hopping on this I recently implemented a handful of new research back techniques and managed to gain a mean 20 lb in 16 months and there's five things I did number one has to do with my training there's a really exciting new area of research called stretch mediated hypertrophy this is something I've covered in depth in the past video but basically some muscles seem to grow faster from exercises that challenge them the most when they're in a stretch position this has now been shown with the biceps triceps quads and hamstrings and to be honest it seems like it will be true for most or even all of our muscles to take advantage of this there's two things I did first exercise selection let's take the biceps for example a recent 2022 study compared two exercises preacher curls and incline curls preacher curls are most difficult right around here when the biceps are almost fully stretched whereas incline curls based on the incline angle used in the study are most difficult a little bit higher up when the biceps are almost fully contracted after 9 weeks of testing the two the preacher curl led to around 150% more growth other recent studies on the biceps have found similar results but there seems to be a similar effect with the triceps too one study had subjects do overhead extensions with one arm and your normal triceps push down with the other arm likely because of the greater stretch on the triceps the overhead exercise led to significantly more growth so to apply this in my weekly routine I made sure I was doing at least one exercise that really challenged each muscle in a stretch position and aside from the ones I just shared with you I also did behind the body curls for biceps behind the body cable lateral raises for shoulders seated leg curls for hamstrings and Bulgarian split squats for glutes but there's one more thing I did to focus on the stretch position even more and honestly I think this is what really made the difference so I've always been obsessed with Progressive overload and just lifting more weight and doing more reps every workout while important it's easy to get carried away you start lifting heavier but it comes at the expense of form you don't go quite as deep or you start using just a bit more momentum these little compensations decrease the challenge you put on your muscles in that stretch position so although I was lifting heavier over time I wasn't actually seeing very good results so I decided to First lighten the weight on almost all my movements by about 10 to 20% I then tried to go as deep as I could with good form and for some exercises like presses and squats I even added a half-second pause at the bottom although I wasn't lifting this heavy my muscles were challenged so much more especially during that deep stretch and they responded extremely well to this your goal isn't to lift as much weight as possible it's to use that weight to challenge your muscles as much as possible knowing that will completely change the way you train and save you from a lot of injury down the road now even if you do all the best exercises and use the right form form if you're not applying this next step you're not going to grow it wasn't until I fixed this that I realized how much it was holding me back so in order to maximize growth you need to get close enough to failure during each of your sets research suggests that at least within three reps of failure is the threshold the more experience to get the more important this becomes now even though I was aware of this I'll be honest after I built up a decent amount of muscle I just got comfortable I wasn't training as hard as I could have been and was just going through the motions it wasn't until I started really pushing myself close enough to True failure that I started really seeing my growth take off and let me tell you it's very easy to think you're pushing hard enough when in reality you still have more to get a recent meta analysis released just last year found that in weightlifting studies subjects would on average stop their sets almost 10 reps before they reached failure and even well-trained lifters have been shown to underestimate their Max effort by around 1 to two reps on average believe me the difference between stopping a set three plus reps short of failure compared to pushing through to just one to two reps short of failure is a whole other level of pain this won't be comfortable and it never gets easier but there are a few things I did that help first I changed my mindset towards the pain I simply view it as a sensation and I now link that feeling of pain with growth so now it's almost like my brain is looking forward to and seeking that pain because I know it's going to result in future growth and second I always take at least a few seconds to just close my eyes and mentally prepare myself in the next set it's so easy to let your mind get distracted when you're working out and start scrolling through social media but to push to the levels required to truly force your muscles to grow you need to get locked in and that happens before you've even started your set and lastly there's no way you're going to be able to do a crazy amount of volume every your workout once you start training with this level of effort that's why it's essential that you implement Point number three recovery so your workouts are what provide the stimulus for your muscles to grow but the actual growth happens when they're resting and recovering thing is most people think that recovery only has to do with your rest days but the most important part of managing your recovery actually has to do with your workout program you see for years I would always train at least six and sometimes even s days a week when I was younger I could do this no problem but over time especially after applying the last tip it just became too much I stopped looking forward to my workouts I had low energy and my muscles just didn't recover very well so I cut down my workouts to just five per week I recently cut it down even more to just four slightly longer workouts per week with the occasional accessory date almost instantly after making the switch I felt much better day today and a lot more energized going into my workouts and I definitely noticed my muscles recovered and grew a lot better as a result don't get me wrong you still need to train hard and you still need to do enough weekly volume to grow research suggests at least 8 to 10 sets per muscle per week but more isn't always better and what someone else can recover from might end up being too much for you keep in mind that your workouts aren't the only stress your body has to recover from your work your life and your relationships can all be added stressors and your body and mind just may not have the recovery capacity to commit to 5 plus days a week in the gym so don't force it and listen to the signs your body has giving you all right so far we've talked a lot about training but all that training wouldn't have done much if I didn't modify my diet you see to maximize growth research suggests you probably need to be eating in a calorie Surplus also commonly referred to as a bulk but just like with workout volume more calories isn't always better one study compared the effects of a fast bulk versus a slow bulk both groups were in a calorie Surplus but the fast group ate on average about 600 calories more than the slow Group after 10 weeks the fast group gained more than twice as much weight about five times as much fat and only a tiny bit more muscle than the slow Group which actually didn't reach statistical significance so what I did was a lean bulk this is when you purposefully overfeed your body with just a bit more calories than it needs typically around 10 to 15% above your maintenance calories for me this started at about 2900 calories and ended up at a little bit over 3,000 calories by the end of the bul and if you need some help figuring out the right amount of lean bulk calories for you you can check out my calculator over at builtwith size.com calulator however even with a lean bulk you probably will gain some fat the 20 lbs I gained definitely was not all muscle and this can be tough to accept it's hard seeing your abs and muscle definition slowly fade away especially during summertime and in my case it was really hard mentally especially with all the pressure to constantly be shredded for YouTube and social media in the past I'd always go back to dieting whenever I saw just a bit of fat gain and so I never really progress this time I decided to stick through it and I'm telling you it paid off tremendously so shift your mindset and think of it as a long-term investment you have plenty of Summers to get shredded in the future and your body is only going to look even better with more muscle on your frame so tip number five was probably the hardest thing to implement you see a fat loss is a relatively fast process you can easily lose one to two lounds of pure fat per week but in comparison once you pass the beginner stage of training it can take several months to gain even just one L pound of muscle I mean I gained 20 lbs but not all of that was muscle and it took me almost a year and a half to do but don't let this discourage you the small games you make week to week will overtime amount to Big noticeable changes our built with science members here are a perfect example of this and show what's possible if you trust the process I mean you can see the incredible difference that adding even just 10 to 15 PBS of muscle to your body can make so be patient don't try to rush it and if you want a stepbystep training and nutrition plan that takes care of all the guess work for you just head to buildwi science.com and take take our quiz to find the best science back plan for you and your body give this video watch next to learn more about the muscle stretch research I covered earlier and how to use

    "transcript": "It's been years since you've gone to the gym\nbut today, you finally muster up the willpower to change your lifestyle. You're super hyped\nand right off the bat, you go to the gym and grab the heaviest weights you can handle and\nstart going all out. Eventually, your muscles begin to ache, and you finally stop when the\npain is too much. After a few minutes of rest, the soreness goes away and you feel good to\ngo again. Same goes for running. The faster and longer you run for, the more sore your\nlegs begin to feel. This immediate soreness, known as acute muscle soreness, happens when\nyou work out very vigorously, causing chemical and fluid buildup in the muscle tissue. The\nmuscle starts losing power and the soreness gets worse, but the soreness goes away after\nresting for several minutes. Then, 8 hours or so after your workout, you\nstart feeling a different soreness in your muscles. It isn't too bad but it definitely\nhurts. 24 hours later, your muscles start get to REALLY sore, to the point that\nyou can barely even move! This is known as Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, or DOMS for\nshort. If you're a regular into the fitness world, you're probably familiar with DOMS.\nBut if you're new, DOMS can catch you off guard and even scare you away from ever working\nout again. The cause of DOMS is from eccentric contractions, or when a muscle becomes longer\nwhile under tension. An example would be the descending portion of a biceps curl, causing\nthe biceps brachii muscle to lengthen. The exact cause of pain from DOMS is unknown,\nbut the most widely accepted reasoning is that during these eccentric movements, very\nsmall tears happen in the muscle at a cellular level. Painreceptors in the muscles then send\npain signals to the brain, and calcium builds up in the muscle, causing inflammation.\nThere are several ways to relieve the pain from DOMS, including a long list of things\nyou can consume. A study in 2010 showed that the individuals taking supplements of the\namino acid L-glutamine were able to significantly relieve the effect of DOMS. In 2013, a study\nshowed that ingesting caffeine 1 hour before exercise was able to significantly decrease\npain from DOMS on the second and third days following workout. The only catch is that\nyou'll need to ingest 400mg of caffeine, which is equal to about 3-4 cups of coffee. For\nlate night exercisers, this might not be a good idea. Other supplements that have shown\nto help alleviate DOMS are creatine, fish oil, taurine, branch chained amino acids,\nand citrulline malate. But to really alleviate DOMS, it's less about\nwhat you take and more about what you do. The best way to alleviate DOMS long term is\nto progress slowly into a new exercise program, giving muscles enough time to adapt to the\nnew stress being placed. Going with lighter weights in the beginning is the magical ingredient.\nOver time, soreness from DOMS can disappear completely as long as the muscle is continuously\nexercised. Studies have also shown that self-myofasical release, or self-massage in the form of foam\nrolling, can alleviate DOMS as well. In a study, researchers found that foam rolling\nexhausted muscles anywhere between an hour to six hours after workout significantly alleviated\nmuscle soreness the next day, making foam rolling a staple workout equipment for individuals\nsusceptible to soreness. But the most important thing you can do in order to alleviate DOMS,\nespecially when beginning a new program, is getting plenty of sleep. The body recovers\nfrom daily activities the most when asleep, which will also help in recovering from muscle\nsoreness and DOMS. Not sleeping enough can cause DOMS to last longer than it should,\nso make sure to get all the rest you can! What other ways have you dealt with muscle\nsoreness after your workouts? Please share your experience in the comment section below!"

a few things you need to keep in mind like what's your body's chloric needs so first let's talk about your BMR which stands for your basil metabolic rate now this is your Baseline amount of calories your body requires to function if you did no activity like laying in bed all day now you want to add your activity on top of your BMR which will tell you how many calories you need to ingest to maintain your current body weight and I know what you're thinking how the hell do I track all my activities throughout the day now this is where a TDE calculator comes [Music] in with some simple information it will give you your caloric needs to maintain your current body weight and give recommendations for calories and macros depending on your goal now it might not be that accurate or work perfectly but it's a good starting point I went ahead and pulled up the TDE calculator and you'll notice that it's going to want some questions answered which is going to be your age your height your weight your body fat percentage and your activity level not everyone's going to know their body fat percentage unless you get it tested want a little bit more accurate estimate but I just guessed on mine at around 15% and once you get all those questions answered it's going to pull up a different page showing a bunch of numbers now it's going to start off with your maintenance calories and as you see for me it's around 3500 calories a day which I feel like is a little bit high but it's also going to detail different macro splits do you want a mod carbohydrates do you want lower do you want higher carbohydrates you'll also notice that it shows your BMI which is your body mass index now this is something I would ignore uh it's really just showing where your weight should be at compared to your height and you'll notice that being 225 lb at 6'2 I am overweight and it recommends I should be around 167 to around 189 lb it does not take your muscle mass into account and they even specify that uh on the page there saying hey if if you weights ignore this and I would recommend doing the same you can also choose your goals so we're talking about in the beginning do you want to lose weight do you want to gain weight well they have a cutting and a bulking tab as well to detail what your calorie should be uh depending on your goal so I think that's pretty cool so going into the cutting tab trying to lean out it says I should be around 2900 calories a day and choosing the 40 4020 split I would say this macro split and calories are pretty spoton now that we got that out of the way let's go over what macros are or macronutrients some things to take in consideration the benefits and some of the drawbacks for those new to the whole nutrition thing the main macronutrients are fats carbs and proteins fats are the most calorically dense macro which is 9 calories per gram and carbs and proteins are 4 calories per gram and a macronutrient split is how you split those macronutrients in your meals throughout the day through at the grocery store now and we have a list of foods we want to be picking up and we're going to be starting with foods that contain a little bit more fat first and I remember growing up the big diet Trend at the time was fat-free foods in contrast to today which is more low carb foods but uh when I was growing up it was all about staying away from fats fats were unhealthy for you but thankfully that's changed now fats are looked at as something that's essential for a healthy diet they're the most concentrated source of energy in food providing as we found out earlier 9 calories per gram they can also help the body absorb fat soluble vitamins such as vitamins a d e and K supporting cell growth and are used used as the building blocks of hormones and of course fats can make food taste more flavorful however there are some downsides eating too much fat can lead to an increased risk of diabetes cancer and other health conditions the American Diabetes Association recommends including more monounsaturated and polyunsatured fats over the common saturated or trans fats found in processed foods some great easy food choices that contain healthy fats are avocados eggs salmon and nuts like almonds and walnuts now the DGA or the dietary guidelines for Americans recommends getting around 20 to 35% of your daily calories from fat which is around 44 to 78 G of fat if you're on an average 2,000 calories a day diet we're on to our carbohydrate sources now and there's usually a handful I stick with sweet potatoes whole grain breads oatmeal brown rice and fruits like bananas and blueberries but one thing is for sure carbs are an excellent source of energy carbohydrates or carbs are the body's primary source of energy they provide energy for the brain which is recommended having up to around 50 to 135 grams of glucose or carbohydrates a day and provide energy for your heart kidneys and central nervous system glucose from carbohydrates is also stored in the liver and muscles for future use as well as you work out you'll use and lose that glucose or energy stores and that's why you'll see marathon runners bodybuilders and powerlifters prioritize carbohydrates for better performance or to look more pumped now some of the health benefits of carbs include digestion fiber type of carbohydrate helps with digestion and can keep cholesterol levels in check mood some research suggests that carbs may help produce serotonin a brain chemical that can improve your mood weight loss quinoa and beans are high in fiber and protein which can help you feel Fuller longer and in turn May Aid in weight loss now there are two types of carbohydrates simple and complex simple carbs are digested quickly and provide a quick burst of energy while complex carbs are digested more slowly and provide a more SU sustained release of energy now sugars are a simple carbohydrate and although sugars can make things taste nice and sweet there is a downside to having too much sugar especially with foods that contain added sugar consuming too much sugar can lead to a number of health problems including weight gain type 2 diabetes heart disease tooth decay kidney disease fatty liver acne premature aging and cognitive decline so as you can see staying away from added sugar can be very important now added sugars are usually found in more proc ESS Foods in the form of sucrose and syrups like high fructose corn syrup make sure to take a quick look at the ingredients list on the back of any pre-made food to find out what's truly inside but your safest bet is to stay with Whole Foods or at least ones that contain very few ingredients now the DGA recommends having around 45 to 65% of your total daily calorie coming from carbohydrates which is around 225 to 325 G of carbs if you're on a 2,000 calorie a day diet so we are on to the protein sources now and I'll typically stick with around the same protein sources chicken salmon Cod eggs and especially living a active lifestyle working out a lot I have to prioritize protein make sure I get enough because protein is extremely important protein is a powerhouse it's a fundamental component of Bones muscles skin cartilage hair and nails the body uses protein to repair and build muscle tissue helps regulate hormones makes enzymes which help digest food creates new cells and chemicals and AIDS red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body now protein is made up of amino acids which are a chemical building blocks the body uses amino acids for various important tasks throughout the body including repairing and building muscle tissue which is why it's so important to ingest extra protein if you're an active person but as you can tell protein isn't just for bodybuilders it's for everyone now a study done by Harvard suggests that the base amount of protein we need is 36 g of protein per pound a body weight which for me weighing 225 lb is only around 82 g of protein per day now this is why it can get a little confusing I mean who do you listen to I'll tell you one thing I didn't get the physique I have today by following recent Harvard studies and following the DGA recommended macros per day I listen to my own body how it responded to my nutrition and how I felt logging my food taking progress pictures and making small adjustments as I learned what worked and what didn't and this is why you might feel like you aren't getting the results you want now I'm not saying science and research is completely invest valid but you have to remember everyone is different and you're going to need your own unique requirements now that you have a better understanding of nutrition we want to go over a few steps you can do to help you understand how your body is responding to your nutrition now the first step is to start tracking your food every day by downloading a calorie and macr tracking app now there are a lot out there so we'd recommend trying a few ones out and seeing which style you like most try to prepare your food ahead of time now food prep can be an essential part in staying consistent with your daily calories and macros now this doesn't have to be anything crazy either I mean it could just mean cooking extra meat and rice instead of your normal serving size for dinner so you have some left over for the next few days take progress pictures weigh yourself and log how you feel now an easy way to implement this is scheduled taking pictures every morning each week so you'll have a catalog of how you look physically now this is an easy way to get a quick look on how you're progressing over the months weigh yourself every morning before eating or drinking anything and log it in your app or notebook as the months pass by you'll be able to average out how much weight you've lost or gained in comparing it to your calories and macros you'll be able to see what your body's responding to best track how you feel now this is optional but it can be important in knowing what you're eating is making you feel like do you feel fatigued unfocused or do you feel energize now this might be a telling sign you need to change up your macro split or even the amount of calories you're having to ensure you're feeling and Performing your best Now by doing these steps you'll be able to find out how your body is responding to your nutrition and over time make small adjustments so you'll continue to get results and although it might be tempting to jump on a popular diet plan like intermittent fasting keto or carnivore we would recommend to start slow and try to maintain a healthy whole food diet before jumping into anything extreme there you go dudes a quick beginner's guide to nutrition I hope this video

    "url": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=INOlxY7lpGs",
    "video_id": "INOlxY7lpGs",
    "transcript": "the soreness you feel a day or two after a workout is something you're all probably familiar with this feeling known as delayed onset muscle soreness or Dom's is thought to be caused by microscopic tears in your muscle fibers that occur from resistance training or just a novel stimulus in general and aside from just being generally uncomfortable particularly with leg soreness too much soreness can also negatively impact your training if it carries over into your next workouts studies show that training a muscle while it's still sore can reduce the activation of the desired muscle reduce the force capacity of the muscle by up to 50% and negatively interfere with a recovery process therefore it's vital that you take the necessary steps in order to minimize post workout soreness and speed up the muscle recovery process and although two common suggestions are to take ice baths or stretch after your workout this actually isn't the best advice to take although ice baths may slightly help with muscle soreness they've also been shown to hinder muscle growth and strength by interfering with a muscle recovery process and as for static stretching multiple studies from the Journal of Sports Medicine have indicated that it actually doesn't help with muscle soreness and may interfere with the recovery process as well therefore both of these wouldn't be the ideal solution for those who want to prioritize muscle growth and strength so what exactly can you do well aside from the general recommendations of been taking adequate protein and getting enough sleep there's a few extra steps you can take which is exactly what I'll cover in this video self myofascial release most commonly done in the form of foam rolling has become increasingly popular in recent years aside from its positive effect on improving mobility it seems to also be an effective way of reducing muscle soreness and although research is still lacking of the four available studies that have directly analysed the effect of formal and on muscle soreness three of them showed a positive effect on reducing muscle soreness and enhancing muscle recovery and this reduction in muscle soreness seemed to enhance the workout performance of the subjects in their next workouts so how exactly can you apply this well I'd suggest foam rolling after your workout for around 10 minutes or so and stick the muscles you work that day especially the ones that tend to experience the most soreness you can also do the foam roll in a few hours after your workout if that's more convenient for you as for how to properly for morale I'll save that topic for another video for now just focus on not going over a muscle too quickly and for really tight areas keep the pressure on it until you feel it release and if you're looking to purchase a foam roller I'll leave a few links to some of my personal suggestions in the description box down below another thing you can do to reduce muscle soreness is incorporate active recovery which includes cooldowns low intensity exercise and so on again not many studies have looked into this but the few studies that have found that active recovery either performed immediately after a workout or within the days following the workout reduced muscle soreness more than when no active recovery was used so in order to implement this I suggest performing 5 to 10 minutes of active recovery or cool down after your workout especially for leg workouts this can be done after your formal and if you're going to do that as well but the most important part when it comes to active recovery is to use a low intensity exercise that involves the muscles you worked for example low intensity cycling would be ideal after a leg day whereas something like rowing or swimming would be ideal after an upper body day or arm day now although there's several supplements out there that claim to enhance muscle recovery and reduce muscle soreness the truth is research is relatively inconclusive when it comes to this however the research behind Omega threes is promising now only have Omega 3 has been recently shown to improve anabolic signaling which may improve muscle repair and growth but multiple other studies have shown that supplementation of around 1 to 3 grams per day of Omega 3s significantly reduces muscle soreness following resistance training exercise so taking a few high quality Omega 3 fish oil pills daily and increasing your fish intake can be another viable way of reducing muscle soreness and improving overall recovery and as for other supplements ingesting caffeine prior to your workout has been and two recent studies to significantly reduce post-workout muscle soreness however the catch is that both studies used a dosage of around 400 milligrams of caffeine which is the equivalent of around four cups of coffee simply meaning that's just not feasible for someone to implement this protocol on a daily basis but with that being said some other supplements that have for the most part shown a positive effect on muscle soreness and may be of interest to some of you our taurine l-citrulline and l-glutamine as I've mentioned in my other muscle soreness video using your way into a program is the one thing you can do that will have the biggest effect on reducing your muscle soreness if you're a beginner or D trained or just starting a new exercise routine the best thing for you to do is to take a few weeks to ease into your program meaning that you should work at volumes and intensities that are lower than you normally would in order to prevent excessive soreness from occurring so to some of the video in order to minimize muscle soreness and enhance muscle recovery foam well after your workout for 10 minutes or so with a focus on the muscles you work that day perform active recovery after your foam rolling as well or the day after your workout again with a focus being on the muscles that you worked increase your omega-3 intake to roughly 1 to 3 grams per day from high-quality sources and finally ease into your program by gradually building up the volume and intensity of your workouts that's pretty much it for the video guys thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed it and found it useful as always I've posted a written summary of this video on my website built with science comm so for those interested in reading it I'll leave a link to it in the description box down below I'd also really appreciate it if you guys gave me a follow on Instagram and Facebook as well where I try to post a lot of informative content on a more regular basis so I'll leave links to both of those in the description box down below as well and I'm currently trying to plan my videos for the next couple months so let me know in the comments what kind of content you'd like to see going forward I'm definitely gonna cover some science-based nutrition videos for muscle growth and fat loss but let me know if there's anything else you think the majority of you would find interesting I think maybe so doing a science-based bodyweight workout series would be pretty interesting but let me know if that's something you guys would find useful anyways as always surety support for this video by giving it a like leaving a comment down below and subscribe to my channel if you

    "video_id": "sEdyG01QKPI",
    "transcript": "hey what's up guys I'm out with the movement system in this video we're going to talk about how to determine sets and Reps for strength training we're going to look at one chart that puts it all together and gives you a good reference for how many sets and Reps you should be doing for each exercise also in case you don't already have a program template I'll put the exact program template that I use in the description below to download completely for free that way you guys have something to use for programming all right let's go and dive into it alright so let's go ahead and take a look at prilippins chart now prilippins chart was created by Alexander prilippin he was a USSR weightlifting coach who essentially took all the data from his athletes and then condensed it into one chart of how he wrote programs and a lot of people have been using it since I know I learned it from Elite FTS a few years ago and I think it's a really good chart to understand and be able to reference whenever you're determining sets and Reps for your clients and athletes okay so let's go ahead and take a look at how this chart works again this is for strength in power programming for the primary lifts Olympic lifts and your compound main barbell lifts so the way the charts lineup is on the leftmost side you can see percent that Wonder at Max and we can go anywhere from 55 winner Max to 90 plus one rep max depending on how many sets and Reps we're going to be doing when we're doing strength and power movements with lower weight around that 55 to 65 100 Max we can handle more volume so what that's saying is we can do up to around three to six sets of three to six reps ideally we would want to Target around 24 reps total so for example four sets of six around say sixty percent Wonder at Max of a compound lift that's towards the higher end of volume of what we would really be training for our main strength and power lifts for the most part we might be around sets of three four five reps a little bit lower in the chart for example if we're working between 70 to 80 percent 100 Max we may Target a total of around 18 repetitions something like four sets of four of a power clean for example might fall into this range where you would Target around 75 to 80 one or at Max and work those four sets of four for a total of around 16 reps you might be wondering why don't we go more reps or why don't we go less reps more reps than that on these main strength power moves has been shown to increase central nervous system fatigue and we get decreased Effectiveness from those reps if we want to add more volume to a program we typically wouldn't go beyond that in our compound lifts we may just add more accessory movements to that program so really this chart is just showing us how to program our main compound lifts but if we were only doing say five or eight reps in this range so say something like two sets of four or three sets of one that's probably not going to be enough volume to get adequate adaptation so that's why we're really targeting that for example 18 reps in that second column what you can start to see though is there's a trade-off with more and more weight so if you wanted to use 80 to 90 percent one rep max for your main compound lifts these are getting heavier now so we can't do quite as many reps we should be targeting around two to four sets of two to four Reps for a total of around 15 repetitions obviously that two to four gives you a lot of a wiggle room you could do as low as two by two it's probably not quite enough you could do something like four sets of three three sets of four four sets of four ideally though we want to get to that Target total rep range of at least 10 and up to around 20 reps in this 80 to 90 percent range again this is really great for programming Olympic lifts and our main compound barbell lifts so things like barbell back squat front squat deadlifts bench press main compound lifts and then the last spot on this chart before we go into the examples ninety percent plus one or at Max for this we want to Target around one to two sets of one to two Reps for a total of around just four repetitions as we get over 90 one at Max and this is especially true with really well trained lifters these lifts are very taxing so we can't do a ton of volume here instead we need to dial that volume back with something like two sets of two or one set of two being more effective here now you might be wondering do I have to stay exclusively in one range no you could actually do some reps at 80 to 90 and then just a few few top end reps in that 90 plus range so you can combine training from different rep ranges here all right let's go ahead and take a look at a simple program example to see what this actually looks like so let's work on some power cleans let's just say you're working with a fieldsport athlete who wants to develop power and we want to train power cleans for four sets of four if we're doing this that volume is around 16 total reps and therefore we want to be around that 80 to 90 percent range another way you could do that is thinking okay I want to train power cleans in the 80 range so therefore I can look at the sets and Reps in the chart and see two to four sets of two to four reps okay I'm gonna go with four sets of four there's really no rules about this you could just do all four sets at 84 percent typically I like to do a little bit of a build up from set to set so that the last set is the most challenging from there we might work overhead press with more of a strength stimulus so for overhead press we're looking at four sets of five around 78 to 80 percent again this will be a solid set and rep choice for that strength power zone for a athlete who's working on that overhead strength and then looking into the example day two we have barbell back squat we want to program this in that 70 to 80 percent Wonder at Max window so that gives us that range of three to six sets of three to six reps we want four sets of six Reps for this barbell back squat and we're gonna train this around 77 to 80 Wonder at Max and then lastly you can see two heavy sets of snatch this is ninety percent so in this case we're just gonna do two sets at ninety percent this is a good example of using the highest weight but with the lowest volume you would want to obviously build up to this with warm-up sets and you could very well do a few sets that are at eighty percent and then up to your 90 sets again it really just depends on how you want to program in terms of accessory movements you can just fill those in with more traditional set and rep ranges something like three sets of eight three sets of ten that's fine again Pearl pins chart is more for the main compound lifts if you guys do want this template download go ahead and hit the link in the description below to download it for free and then if you guys do want to learn more about program design you can check out my full course program design 101 which teaches you exactly how to write great programs for your clients and athletes it takes you step by

    "video_id": "5z2vWpdMo8k",
    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: So what\nare some tools that we can use to enhance our recovery? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,\nlet's start off with that acute overload phase. So in other words, I just did a\nworkout, and I'm feeling awful or I just did one, two days\nago and I'm super sore. How do I get rid\nof that right now? Well, there's a couple of\nthings you can do immediately after your workout,\nand then others that are maybe more actionable\na day later or two days later. And we'll just cover\na handful of them. We'll do some nutrition, and\nhydration and supplementation. In the next episode, I'm going\nto cover everything else not in that category right now. So a couple of things. Number one, you can actually\nkick start that recovery process at the end of your\ncurrent training session. And I guess I should\nsay it this way, I strongly suggest you\nstart this recovery process immediately after the workout. You mentioned earlier\nabout this idea of, you got to get a really\nhigh peak of stress to cause adaptation. But I actually didn't\nexplain that correctly, because what has\nto happen is, you need that extremely\nhigh peak, but then you have to be met with an extremely\nsharp recovery back down. And so you've talked\nabout this before in some of your neuroplasticity stuff. And in terms of what has to\nhappen that cause the insult, and then you\nimmediately need to be able to recover to make\nsure that causes changes. But the same thing\nhappens here, so we need a really sharp and\nhigh inflammatory response. And then if you do not meet\nit with an immediate recovery period, the signal won't be\nthere to maximize your results. So what's that mean? You can actually do\na couple of things. Number one is, actually\nlistening to slow paced music. There is evidence to suggest\nfast paced music may have slowed down your\nrecovery, and slow pace would actually enhance it. So if you just change\nfrom your maximum, get you up and get going\nmusic during the workout to a slower, lower\ncadence, that will help you kick start the idea. Of a similar note, you can\nalso use what we call down regulation breathing. You could do them in\nconjunction, or one or the other,\nwhichever is up to you. So my personal\nfavorite method here, is somewhere between\n3 to 10 minutes of finishing your training\nsession, laying down. I like to be in that position,\nyou can certainly do it in the Lotus position, but\nI think laying on your back is generally more effective,\npersonal preference, there are no sides. I like the eyes being covered. Getting into this dark,\nquiet sort of area. And then just breathing\nthrough your nose in a structured cadence. There's a lot of different\nthings you can try. An easy example is\njust box breathing. And you can imagine box\nhaving four squares. So what you're going to do is,\nInhale for somewhere between 3 to 8 seconds. And then whatever\nnumber you choose, you keep that same tempo. And so let's say you chose to\ndo a five second inhale, that's going to take you up vertically. And then horizontally for your\nbox, is a five second hold. And then a five second exhale,\nand then a five second hold. And you just need to repeat\nthat for the time domain. I typically honestly,\ndon't use a timer. You'll actually\nnotice a lot of people will fall asleep or get\nreally close to falling asleep in this period. And you could do a triangle\nversion of that, where you do an inhale, hold,\nexhale, and then go right back into your inhale or there's\na bunch of different tricks you can try here. You need to play\naround and see what actually works best for you. 10 minutes is probably\nbetter, but if you can just at least give me\nthree, that'll work. If you're really,\nreally resistant, you can actually do\nthat just in the shower. And so if you're going\nto finish your workout, get in the shower. Again, just close your\neyes in the shower, give me three\nminutes of focused, relaxation breathing and that\nwill accelerate the recovery process. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love\nit, and I particularly love it because my\nlaboratory works on stress and respiration, aka\nbreathing and the interactions between the two. And I'll just mention\na result that was just accepted for\npublication, so it should be out by the time\nthis episode airs. ANDY GALPIN: Hey, congrats. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank you. This is the beautiful\nwork of, not me directly, although it took place in\nmy lab, but as we know, it's the student, the\npost-docs who really do the heavy lifting of\nDr. Melis Balban in my lab, is a phenomenal researcher. That showed that a short\nperiod of five minutes of box breathing, of exactly the\ntype that you described or cyclic sighing,\nso two inhales followed by an extended\nexhale to lungs empty. Ideally, the Inhale is\ndone through the nose, the exhales are done\nthrough the mouth. Although it can all be done\nthrough the nose or the mouth for that matter, but probably\nnose, nose for inhale, inhale, mouth four exhale. Or inhales through the nose\nand exhale through the nose. Cyclic sighing as we refer\nto it, done for five minutes, both of those produce\nvery significant decreases in resting heart rate. They over time will\nincrease things like heart rate variability,\nand so on and so forth. So provided that there\nare extended exhales, it seems like the calming\nresponse and the reduction in overall stress occurs. The only thing that really sends\nthings in the other direction, would be something like\ncyclic hyperventilation. I'm sure you've observed that. And interestingly,\nwhen we had people just do five minutes of meditation,\nduring which of course, they are breathing, but they're\njust allowing their breathing to progress however it happens\nto be in that moment or moments across the five minutes,\nthere were reductions in the same sorts of markers\nof stress that I described, but not as significant\nas breathing. So I love the box breathing\ntool, post workout. And there are some other\nalternatives there too that I'll just mentioned,\nbut I think people greatly underestimate the\npotency of breathing, for shifting one's nervous\nsystem function away from stress or if one\nwants, toward more alertness and stress.
